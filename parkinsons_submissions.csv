So my dad with PD has recently gotten a mobile phone and complained about how heavy it is (it's got a 6.3"" screen and weighs about 180g) and how he gets a bit tired holding it.

So I was thinking of getting one of those simple pop-out holding thingies like this for him for Christmas, but I don't know if it would help with him using the phone? [https://i.imgur.com/x8lSrUI.png](https://i.imgur.com/x8lSrUI.png)

Also, would a stylus make it easier or more difficult to use the screen?

Any other ideas would really be appreciated! Thanks a lot.

He doesn't have tremors much yet btw, if that makes a difference.",2019-12-20 14:15:42
1,Erectile dysfunction early sign,Russpow,1,ecsetq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parkinsons/comments/ecsetq/erectile_dysfunction_early_sign/,2,1576786570.0,"Hello, my father currently has Parkinson’s disease. He was diagnosed at 52. 

I am currently suffering from erectile dysfunction. I’m going to add, I spent several years using steroids for bodybuilding which threw my hormone system out of whack, but it has been almost two years since quitting. 1 full year of no testosterone or anything of that sort. At times it’s not too bad, but at time I have zero sex drive and i have to work really hard to get an erection i can’t keep. 

The concern is, even with normal testosterone levels I still have ED issues. I still have to use viagra and cialis. I can get erections but can’t keep them for sex. Sometimes, I have zero drive to have sex and erections are non existent. 

I feel like my case of ED is more severe than others who have used steroids. It’s been a long time and I feel like I’ll never recover to have normal erectile function. Which gets me thinking, maybe there is another issue at play. Since my father has PD, I thought maybe I may have it too and this is an early sign. 

Whats the likeliness that my ED is being caused by PD? I don’t have any other issues that would point to Parkinson’s. Is it possible that this is a very early sign? Has anyone experienced ED before they had any other symptoms?

The intensity of the twitching has remained more or less the same, but it seems to be spreading to more areas now, and off late has become much more frequent. Earlier I used to experience the twitching mostly in my fingers, but not it's on my legs, stomach, face, arms, etc. 

Also, I do feel some loss of strength in my palms. However, I only feel this when I clench my fists. I also feel a very minor, but almost continous shaking of my body. However I am not sure if it's just general weakness or it's because of the cold weather or it's just an illusion, as I can't detect it visually.

I recently got to know that these can be an early sign of Parkinson's disease. And this has gotten me really worried. On doing some research, I found that muscle twitchings are common, and can be harmless. On the other hand, they can be a sign of some neurological disorder like Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis, ALS, etc. 

Since this is a Parkinson's based forum, I would like to know if there is any test which can accurately detect Parkinson's disease? Are the symptoms I experiencing a strong sign of early stage Parkinson's?

Was it similar to how it feels the day after exercise or lifting weights? More like a dull pain like that or was it more sharp? Whereabouts was the pain? Upper shoulder closer to the neck or side of the shoulder closer to the bicep? 

I’m hyper sensitive to everything right now and not sure if my brain is feeling things that are concerning or if it’s something completely unrelated.

I’ve been experiencing some weirdness the last 4 years (as I’ve posted about in other neurotic posts), and I’ve had a dull pain, mostly in my right shoulder the last week or so. Akin to how it would feel if I lifted some weights for small amount of time. Now, I do swim a few times a week for exercise, but you would figure both shoulders would feel the same from that.

I’ve been reading a lot about multi focal dystonia, which is something I’m concerned that I have. Muscle twitches/spasms on the arch of my right foot for abo 4 years now, right index and thumb want to sort of seize up or bend inward and under, but only when I use a computer keyboard (task specific) for about 3 years now, and recently some left eyelid spasms (which for the most part have just recently gone away, or at least have gone down substantially for now). The last few days I’ve felt none.

My dad has Parkinson’s and got diagnosed in his 40s. I’m 38 and I’m worried he could have passed down some sort of gene related to that or possibly dystonia. He has never been gene tested though so I’m not entirely sure if it’s genetics or dystonia at all. A lot of things seems to line up though, unless my brain is simply convincing itself of certain symptoms.

I’m wondering if multi focal dystonia can typically progress into Parkinson’s. I’ve read some information on multi focal dystonia and most of what I’ve read says that type of dystonia typically peaks and doesn’t progress, and either, in rare cases, can go away altogether or simply remain as it was when it peaked and also that this type of dystonia isn’t typically seen as a symptom of early onset Parkinson’s and more it’s own thing.

Any insight into this specially would be much appreciated if anybody has any knowledge about this.  I do understand that self diagnosing isn’t something I should be dabbling in. I did see a neurologist about 6 months or so ago about my hand and foot, he did all of the basic Parkinson’s test and didn’t seem at all concerned. I’m simply curious about certain types of dystonia and whether or not it’s typical for certain types to lead to something worse.

He was diagnosed with Parkinson's in May. Other than a noticeable tremor and maybe some facial masking, he didn't show a lot of symptoms prior to his fall. (His doctor at the time attributed the tremor to some medication he takes for bipolar disorder).

Since his fall, he's been rotating between using a walker and relying on a wheelchair. He's stiff, falls a lot, freezes constantly. He hallucinates constantly and at night is completely delusional--thinks the staff are trying to poison him, yells and says horrible things to them, is sexually inappropriate, hears voices, etc. He is paranoid during the day (like if I'm late to visit him he becomes fixated on the idea that I've been kidnapped) but calmer.

He is not taking any agonists or other medications that are known to cause hallucinations. He's not even taking levodopa anymore for reasons too long to get into. I know that he wasn't taking care of himself at all before his fall last year, but his decline this year has been pretty shocking. After reading the Lewy Body website I'm starting to wonder if he has that rather than Parkinson's because it just \*seems\* like him, but his memory seems mostly okay. He can't remember his passwords (which are all the same password), but he's still able to participate in conversations. From a treatment perspective, how much does it matter if the doctors think he has LBD rather than PD?

They're currently looking for options to treat his delusions but there is almost nothing to choose from since he also has heart issues.

As part of the process, all potential PwP go through a clinic evaluation...and let me just say it is fabulous.  I got to chat with doctors, admittedly I had no idea about their research contributions but holy smokes they know their stuff. Learned more about alpha synuclein, disease progression, areas of the brain impacted, and the latest research. 

The NIH team is kind, knowledgeable, and humble.  They are looking for volunteers, with a special interest in YOPD.   I think they offer travel support. Reach out to the NIH coordinator if you are interested (link below):

https://neuroscience.nih.gov/ninds/PatientClinicalPrograms/ForPatients/ParkinsonsDiseaseClinic.aspx

The process is entirely voluntary.  And you can choose at any time to opt out of any test.  They do a smell test and collect blood and skin samples for research proposes (again, you can choose to opt out).  I’ve got a needle phobia, so the skin biopsy had me nervous but I wanted to do it anyway (my own way of fighting back against PD).  One of the staff held my hand through the entire process and the research doc kept me distracted.  

I am relatively newly diagnosed.  And I will admit that I had a small hope of being tossed out of any trials on the chance this wasn’t PD. No such luck.

NIH folks repeatedly thanked me for my participation, but honestly I walked away with more knowledge and the hope that there is a team of brilliant and kind people battling this disease.

If you are interested, it may take a while to set up the date for the clinic and you might have to keep trying to contact them.",2019-12-06 09:40:18

It's the only real cure and it's more complicated than you can possibly imagine but it's also brilliant in it's simplicity

I want this post to mean something to someone so I'll go ahead and tell you how to cure Parkinson's

At least this will weed out the people that want to know what the cure is from the people who are afraid of not knowing the cure 

It's connection 

Connection is the cure for Parkinson's

It's really that simple 

So now you know 

Let me ask the real question that is more important than what is the cure for Parkinson's 

It's my original question
A what if question

What if I told you there is a cure for Parkinson's?

So?
What if?
So?
I just told you what the cure is
What now?

And I know I know 

What does that mean?
How can connection cure the most horrible condition in the history of conditions?

Whoa 
Wait a second

Did he just say that Parkinson's is worse than cancer?
Worse than Alzheimer's?
Worse than MS or ALS?
Yes that is what he said 

It's worse than the most common condition than everyone ever born on this earth has

The human condition 

It's worse than that 

How is Parkinson's worse than a terminal illness?
How can it be worse than death?

Well what is Parkinson's?
What is it really?

Again if there are still the people that are defined by fear reading at this point I'll go ahead and tell you the answer and let you continue being scared 

Parkinson's is death that doesn't end 

But again it's more than that 

It is to be AND not to be 
At the same time 
Alive then dead and then back again 
Death that happens slowly is still death
But worse 

So what does all this have to do with the cure 
What does this have to do with connection?

I'll give you the smart ass answer 

Parkinson's is the brain being disconnected from the body 

So you fix this by connecting the brain to the body 

This is how you cure Parkinson's 
Right?

Of course but how do you do this?

Okay this is the last weed out I'm gonna do so if any of you are still reading at this point have a fear of what I'm about to tell everyone this is the answer you want 

I don't know how to physically connect the brain back to the body 

But I do know the meaning of life
I think I do anyways

I think therefore I am right 
How about i choose therefore I am 

This is where things get interesting 
Hopefully the ones still reading this are the ones that are really searching for a way to cure Parkinson's 

Because this I know 

How do you really cure Parkinson's 
What is Parkinson's really?
Parkinson's is the only way to experience death 
Because Death is an end 
It always ends so who can possibly experience death and if anything happens after death?

Who could possibly know this?
Well 95% of the worlds population claim to know 
They call life after death heaven and hell right 
What if I told you you there is something worse than hell?
Something better than heaven?
Something better than God?
If there was such a thing how could I know what it is?

There is something better than God
It's us
Each other 

Connecting to each other is the only real cure for Parkinson's 
It's the cure for death 
Parkinson's is living WITH death 
Death is disconnection from each other 

Living with this disconnection is how I learned this 
It's the only way to learn this 

So back to my real question 

What if I told you there is a cure for Parkinson's?
What would you do?

Now you know",2019-12-05 10:43:30

I have been there personally to see exactly what they are submitting.  I have sat there and overheard the conversation between the staff at his facility and the insurance company and what they tell me and what they tell them is completely different.  They come up with another hoop to jump through almost every week.  We waited patiently while we got through the first 90 days.  We submitted everything we were sent to complete.  When no reimbursement was forthcoming and I started asking questions, they just gave me the run around.  Every time you call them they say they have 15 days to review your situation.   After 15 days they come up with yet another reason not to pay.

He doesn't believe that he needs to stop eating and drinking that much. In his idea the overweight is not coming from the food and drinks. We all say it in this house and he still won't believe it. I also have the idea that he eats more if we say somehting about it (a little bit childish). It kilss the mood in our house what i don't like. I have the idea that goes to a care home in a few months because he can't live not normally anymore and i don't want that.

\- Can this behaviour be related to parkinson?- What can i do to make it clear for him that he needs to stop with eating and drinking of so much sugar?

He used to just have a slight tremor in his hand, now he constantly shakes throughout his whole body, and has trouble searching for words to use. It’s like he is using different words to supplement his usual vocabulary. He also has difficulty speaking, stuttering every word. 


My question is, is there anything that could be accelerating his condition? 

I have read that stress can influence the severity so it should be worth noting that my Grandma was also recently diagnosed with colon cancer, but it hasn’t spread and she had surgery to clear her from it, now cancer free. He also works in construction as a superintendent for a commercial firm, making returning to work almost impossible. He also has had 10 surgery’s total on both of his shoulders from a prior work injury where he tore the muscle off of the bone.

[[Please Note: I am not a medical professional, just a regular person who's been researching possible treatment options for Parkinson's Disease]]

This is alarming. 

Intermittent Fasting (IF) has been shown to provide many benefits to health and longevity. It promotes new brain cell growth in mice. It is thought to help protect against developing neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimers, and possibly PD. 

An important question arises: could IF help people who already have PD to slow or even stop the advance of the disease? Could IF revive damaged dopaminergic neurons in the  substantia nigra region of the brain, restoring natural dopamine levels?

Unfortunately, the linked study has very troubling implications for people with PD who practice IF. 

Mice that were given a drug (Rotenone) that causes them to develop Parkinson's symptoms, were then put on IF diets for four weeks (24 hours of fasting alternated with 24 hours of regular feeding). At the end, the mice were killed and their substantia nigra were assessed for presence of dopaminergic neurons (the more the better) and presence of α-synuclein (the less of these invasive plaques, the better). 

The mice treated with the PD-causing drug Rotenone who were also put on IF had nearly all of their dopaminergic neurons wiped out, and had high levels of α-synuclein.  

Scroll down in the linked article to Figure 2 to see the images of their brain tissue. There were four groups of mice: healthy control group, healthy group on IF diet, PD group (those given the Rotenone to simulate PD), and the PD IF diet group. In Figure 2, the (good) dopaminergic neurons have been stained in red. 

Unless/until more is known about the impact of IF on PD, I would caution anyone with PD against Intermittent Fasting without first consulting PD experts.",2019-11-30 02:03:50

For the last 7 months I’ve been experiencing chronic dizziness (feeling lightheaded, not vertigo), mental/cognitive fatigue, and crazy orthostatic hypotension. I also developed a small hiatal hernia, which I've heard is typical in PD. 

My sleep used to be perfect back before March 2019; I’d close my eyes at 9PM and wake up at 7AM the following day. Now, I close my eyes at 11PM, stay awake until 12AM, fall asleep at 1AM, and wake up at 4AM, only to fall asleep again and wake up at 9AM.

Some days I have tremors, other days I don’t. When I have tremors, they are bilateral and feel like I’m high on caffeine/stage fright. For some time, I had a random twitch affecting my right thumb and index fingers, but that went away after 2-3 weeks.

I don’t have trouble walking, nor do I feel stiff, except for a few mornings here and there where my neck and shoulders feel like I slept on a rock. Even then, that goes away by afternoon’s time. 

That being said, there were days where I would wake up with muscle soreness, despite not having gone to the gym for weeks. This no longer happens.

Still, I'm left troubled because I wake up everyday feeling hypoglycemic from the lightheadedness caused by what feels like low blood pressure, insane orthostatic hypotension, and bad quality of sleep. My grandfather was DXed with PD in his 70s, allegedly from the pesticides he was exposed to as a farmer.

MRI came back fine and neurologist dismissed it as nothing.

Since around age 10 I've always had shaking in my legs and arms but only when holding them up in certain position's. I never really told anyone and just accepted it and as a child didn't pay it much attention. 

Going forward 11 years my shaking has got to the point where it's really starting to bother me so, aged 22, I saw the doctor who referred my to a Neurologist under the suspicion of it being an essential tremor. 

I shake everywhere in my body when I'm using the muscle. So if I try and smile my mouth tremors, if I try to drive and operate pedals my legs shudder, if I hold my legs up I tremor quite violently (to to the point where I look like my entire body is convulsing). Turning my hands causes them to judder while turning and even my fingers shake. Going down stairs can be a nightmare. Essentially every part of my body I use or apply some sort of strain to the muscles to (via using them) I tremor and in some cases quite severely. Right side of me is worse noticeable when I hold my arms out in front of me . 

I just feel like I'm permanently tensing and holding my arms up can make them feel tired, even for a second. 

When I saw the neurologist she immediately said I had dystonic tremor and dystonia which was odd for someone of my age. She did a blood and urine test to rule out a host of other things.  The neurologist also said I had reduced swing in my arm while walking and a resting tremor on my right arm, something I'd never noticed. She's immediately prescribed Levodopa which seems to be helping with the tremor.

It also seems to help with alertness and sleep too which I've yet to report back. Oddly, I also feel less tired and forgetful and less in pain when I'm holding my arms up. 

I've taken a look at Dystonia but I don't seem to have as many symptoms in common with that compared to Parkinson's, which seems at odds with the diagnosis. I don't have muscle twisting commonly associated with Dystonia. It's also not focused in one area.

Does this sound like it could be Parkinson's or more in line with the Dystonia diagnosis?",2019-11-29 01:10:44

I dont know the name of my Dad's med. he has been through several and the last one was in a patch form that they were trying to see if he could tolerate it. Unfortunately as he started it he also had a coke with dinner and something mesed with his sleep. he has been on sleep med the past two years after his stroke. But he had a coke with dinner for several nights when he started the new med. He went one night no sleep. Then good sleep then little sleep. next night he had trouble falling asleep and removed patch and could sleep. He hasnt called his neurologist yet and wont use the med. But I see his tremors are worse. He gets more withdrawn too. So my question.

Medication for Parkinsns...does it just work on the effects...ie his tremors...or does it work by effecting the brain. My dad sees parkinsons as just the effects he sees and as I understand it it effects the brain which then causes the effects he sees. So even if it doesnt do much good for the tremors is it still helping the brain and/or nervous system. Thus if he stops taking meds for his Parkinsons because its not solving his tremors that would have an adverse affect on his brain  function. 

Thank you.",2019-11-28 08:03:30

I had an MRI and my results were great/normal.

Saw the neurologist today and went to the wrong office, and was fifteen minutes late. I have a staff meeting later and accidentally put on a little perfume and was trying to wash it off with a Kleenex and water on the way there. The doctor was super specific about no smoke or heavy deodorant smells and I was close to a full blown panic attack.

It seemed ok. And the appointment was short. She still does not want to say I have Parkinson's despite of my abnormal DATscan and brushed it off as people aren't symmetrical in our features so there are going to be some variances in our brains? But that confused me and I didn't know how to ask for clarification on what she meant, because my brain had a symmetrical drop of dopamine NOT an asymmetrical drop.

I'm happy to have my levodopa and I am doing... ok? I don't feel normal. She asked about my anxiety and I said it was better and medication hadn't helped before. I was kind of hopefully she would say, ""well let's try this one it is better for people with PD."" but she didn't. 

She got me a year supply of levodopa prescribed and said to come back in a year unless something happened. I don't know what to tell my coworkers or family. It is easier for people to understand if I say, ""I have early onset Parkinson's"" but I don't want to be disingenuous. I feel a lot of trepidation over telling people that I have ""Dopa responsive dystonia"" because I have to explain that and it has the same symptoms and treatment as Parkinson's. 

It just feels like a cop out and she was not happy I researched it and was like ""but my insomnia, hallucinations, and I feel worse in the morning"" she brushed it off with ""everyone is different""",2019-11-28 01:07:04

My mother was diagnosed with this debilitating disease when she was 40 years old, as I was only a small child. While of course the toll this has taken has been hardest to bear for her and for my dad, who has been her full-time caretaker since an early retirement, I can't help but think that my recurring issues with anxiety and general angst have been caused by knowing that my mother is ill (and progressively so). It can only be described as a life-long grieving process that has now been exacerbated by observing my dear mother's severe cognitive decline and weekly, potentially fatal falls.

I live in a different country and constantly am waging an inner war between living my own life as a young adult and the responsibility I feel toward caring for my parents. It does not help that while my father is incredibly dedicated, he is experiencing what I think is carer burnout and is a heavy drinker as a way to cope. I have found it incredibly hard to find support and understanding from my family (I have half siblings from my dad's earlier marriage but grew up as an only child) and friends - while they are kind and often provide a listening ear, and I am of course thankful for their patience and love, they simply cannot truly understand the situation.

As a result, I am considering starting a peer-to-peer support group for other young individuals like myself (age 18-35) who struggle with similar issues. I am interested in hearing from others in similar situations - please also let me know if you feel like such a peer-to-peer support network would be useful!

TLDR at the end. My FIL (72) was diagnosed with Parkinson’s about 2 years ago, he had a fall in July, had surgery on the broken hip, and has never been the same since. His doctor has recently changed his diagnosis to Lewy Body “potentially” and taken him off all Parkinson’s medication. Since the fall and surgery, he has had some major issues with hallucinations, and consistently says many people are there in his home doing any number of random things, sometimes quite scary things. He fell at home again a week or two ago because the hallucinations were “rushing him down the hall” . My MIL also lives in the home with him, but she still works full time. My husband and I live abroad, but try to check in with him via video chat or phone call in the week, and definitely on the weekend. We just worry about how much time he’s spending alone (he doesn’t drive because of vision problems), and how little social interaction he has, as well as how little physical activity he has. He still has a physical therapist coming once a week, but it just doesn’t seem to be enough. He doesn’t seem motivated to do the exercises independently, doesn’t seem motivated to improve his diet or even really ensure he’s fully hydrated throughout the day when he’s left to his own devices. My SIL is staying with them at least until the New Year, but this is in no way a permanent fix. She normally lives several states away. In my mind, he seems depressed, which I know can be a reality for those with Parkinson’s /Lewy Body, and I’ve looked into getting him into the local Parkinson’s boxing group, but he’s definitely not strong enough to do vigorous exercise. He walks with a walker right now and is still quite unsteady.  I guess this is just a long winded way of asking if anyone has experience with the Parkinson’s boxing, or if you think someone with limited strength would benefit from this/ do you know if they do it for different levels of physical capability? I’d love for him to have something he does regularly that may give him social interaction and physical activity. I just feel so helpless being an ocean away watching them struggle to deal with this. 

TLDR; How do I best support my FIL with Parkinson’s/ Lewy Body from far away? Is Parkinson’s boxing beneficial for all levels of physical fitness?",2019-11-22 23:32:38

Have you ever read an upbeat and affirming story about an old guy with Parkinson’s disease? I have just published a novel about that exact subject: Let’s Pretend: A Tale of Mind, Imagination, and Healing. 

While entertaining, it looks deeply into life’s most important questions and examines how the mind is underused when most thinking related to Parkinson’s is medication oriented. I’ve had Parkinson’s for twelve years and have come this far using exercise and my mind while taking no medication at all.

I wrote Let’s Pretend to inspire my companions who are challenged by this disease.

Patient: Mom in her late 70s. Diagnosed with PD 20+ years ago. Has Deep Brain Stimulation which has been some help. 

Situation: My mom's bridge fell out. The bridge is a 3 tooth bridge. 

Option 1: The dentist says that if she sticks with the bridge, she'll need a four tooth bridge. Apparently, this wouldn't be a permanent bridge though -- it would be one that she'd have to clean five times a day?? The dentist is rightly worried about her ability to remove and install the bridge throughout the day. Getting the price tag on this but...a crown is $1000 so I'm guessing this is at least $5k. Probably more when we're all done.

Option 2 which is what the dentist suggests is that she get 4 to 5 posts drilled into her jaw which I assume means crowns. (Wasn't there for 1st appointment. Going to 2nd.)  Price tag = $20k to $25k!! For the love of God. This would require anesthesia  which makes this an even worse option in my opinion because I feel that 1. she is old 2. she has PD and 3. she has a little short-term memory loss from cataract surgery anesthesia as it is. (Which apparently isn't even full anesthesia.) Also, we don't have $25k. I feel like this is a non-option because of the anesthesia. Also, previously, an oral surgeon told my mother she didn't have enough bone in her jaw. 

Apparently the dentist doesn't recommend dentures. I'm going to push him on this when I see him.

Besides buying a blender and sticking to soft foods, is there another option I'm missing? I thought I'd start here to see if anyone had any advice before I head over to r/Dentistry",2019-11-21 07:21:30

I posted more in depth about my other various symptoms, which could be due to compounded anxiety, or not, in a previous post.

I am a 38 year old male. About 145 pounds. I've had a history of occasional recreational hard drug use over the last decade.

The one thing that has been really freaking me out lately is my eyelid. It has basically been spasming for over a month or so now. Every day. All day. It seemed to have calmed down for a day or two last week but is now worse than ever.

The left eyelid usually starts spasming pretty hard when I blink. Not every time, but lately it’s been at least every other or every third blink and usually when I blink harder. It’s as if the spasm is only triggered when I move my eyelid. The other weird feeling is that it sort of feels like my eyelid opens slower than my right one or sort of feels like it gets briefly stuck and then sort of pops open. I’m terrified that what’s happening is either a spasm hard enough that it’s making it hard to open my left eyelid as fast as my right or that the muscles in my left eyelid aren’t responding properly. The internet tells me this could be dystonia. Could drug use cause nerve damage of some sort that could cause this?

My father has Parkinson’s so I’ve been very concerned about getting it as well. I’m starting to convince myself that I might have the gene or at least some form of it and possibly these are the first symptoms or possibly it’s manifesting in a way where it might only just be some sort of focal dystonia. I also have spasms in my foot that causes the toes to seem like they’re twitching every so often and my right hand contorts in a weird way when I go to type on a keyboard. Kind of like it ceases up in a way where my thumb wants to bend under my index finger. This only happens when I type. I included all of this in my previous post, but I wanted to mostly get some feedback on my eyelid and if anybody has experienced something similar or can suggest what else it could possibly be. My sleep is usually on and off but this seems to persist even after a few good nights sleep. I also stopped my caffeine intake for a week or so with little change. I've read a lot about how eye dystonia and eyelid issues can be an early symptom of early onset parkinsons. I don't seem to have any other balance or movement issues as of right now.

In January my father’s hand was trembling and he was scared about what it could be.  At the end of summer he got in to see a specialist and they confirmed its Parkinsons.  

Here’s a little back story.
- Family business that he started.  I worked in it for 15 years.  Over the last 3 years, I’ve seen his mental capacity decline when it comes to doing simple computer related tasks.  I took on more responsibility and jobs, however at an increasing rate; he would lash out at me.  Screaming things like “do it my way, this is my business”.  
- I ended up having to leave the family business and start out on my own over the last year.  It’s been tough but I’m now doing super great.
- My dad has never been one to fix equipment or take care of “maintenance”. He never made dental hygiene a serious thing and all of his teeth are in bad shape.  He also has a hard time hearing, but refuses to get a hearing aid.
- He’s always been the boss of the house and what he says freaking goes.

Fast forward to today.  I see him lacking the brainpower for making sound decisions.  I mean he is ok for short term thinking... but planning ahead for tomorrow or next week or next month is a no go.  He refuses to go to the local Parkinsons boxing gym.  He says “I’ll deal with it, I’ll buy what I want to do it at home”

So I guess my question to all of you is..... do you have any words of wisdom or advice... to deal with someone who is stubborn, think they should always be the boss/in charge, who refuses to get any help or prioritize treatment?  

My dad has a hobby farm with 18 cows, he wants to run his business (which he cannot do) and he still wants to be calling the shots about everything.  We tell him his priority should be exercising and taking Parkinson’s disease serious... but he will get angry, lash out and walk away.  

Sorry for the long post, I just feel lost and don’t know what to do.

His father had Parkinson's. 

My partner and I have been looking to buy a house, and after speaking to my Dad we've decided to knock down his house (it's very old and has structure issues) and build a new house that will suit all of us.

So far we've planned for him to have a bedroom with ensuite on the ground floor, as well as his own private lounge/living room. The doors for his rooms will be extra wide to  accommodate a wheelchair in the future. We've also planned for his bathroom to have no step into the shower, the floor will be totally flush. 

For those living/caring for someone with PD, what other accommodations would you make? 

It's unlikely that he'll be doing much cooking, but if there are ideas for the kitchen I'd like to hear them.

I was talking to my father the other day. He thought it was  of the sedatives they gave my mom.

Earlier this year, my mother went through a few months of very irritable restless behavior with less than 2hrs of sleep per night, she barely ate, fell hit her head and part of her face drooped. We took her to the ER. Turned out it was UTI. She stayed at the hospital for a week in May.

Then afterwards she did get physical therapy for walking, but it didn't last long. Now she shuffles and is loosing strength in her legs. When we transfer her they quickly give out.

I don't know if anyone has gone through something similar?

&#x200B;

Edit: She was on some medication before. But it turns out it wasn't as much benefit to her. Luckly, once we arrived at the ER and took immediate testing her neurologist was there. I think was triggered that urgency was the partial drooping of the face (could be internal bleeding of the brain from the fall or stoke-like symptoms).",2019-11-19 11:43:32

He used the term A typical which I’m not sure what that means. I’m just curious about my symptoms vs those who have already been diagnosed. I’m a 37 year old male.

Here is what I’ve got going on:

Resting tremor in my right hand and arm, wife says my arm will lightly shake while I’m sleeping.
My right arm always hurts like I strained or pulled a muscle.
Anxiety 
Full body muscle soreness, I feel like I’ve been in the gym doing full body work outs, sore to the point I make facial expressions of discomfort and groan when trying to move(wife’s observations)
Stiffness in my trunk and legs
Abnormal gait though it’s not consistent with Parkinson’s according to my DR. Feels like heavy feet, short steps I walk very slow.
Often lose balance and have stalled steps though I haven’t fallen yet.
Masking facial expression, people often ask me if I’m ok. Usually before my symptoms start to become pronounced.
Fatigue, I get tired more easily and it seems to take less and less activity to cause my body to lock up and become sore.
Lack of sleep even when tired
I seem to become more confused and forgetful lately.
Weirdly my symptoms seem to come and go, I have days I’m perfectly fine but when what ever it is hits, it’s very obvious. When stressed out it seems to make things worse though I can feel just fine mentally and still have these issues.

I have a Dat scan soon, had a MRI that’s come back clear and my blood work has come back good with the exception of some enzyme level.

I know it could be any number of things but the Dr. keeps talking about Parkinson’s or some form of ataxia. Any information or feed back would be helpful, I’m very interested to see if other are going through or have been through what’s happening to me.",2019-11-19 11:38:05

I am now in a chair by her hospital bed for the third night in a row while my step dad lays on the other side. She’s dying. Her Parkinson’s moved very quickly but in the last six months her body took a beating. She had surgery for a hiatal hernia that her PD doctor ok’d, 6 months ago. She never fully mentally recovered from it. The anesthesia, the doctor said. Progressively she went downhill.   Prior to the surgery she could get around with her walker. A little over a week ago she had started to be more mentally hazy than usual a couldn’t leave her bed. She stopped communicating and responding. I went over and went with my step father as they took by esquad to the hospital. For the first three days she was completely unresponsive. She was diagnosed with an infection on day one and they began antibiotics and fluids. On day three she opened her eyes. But she wasn’t there. Another test pointed to a pancreas issue. Then finally aspiration pneumonia. Her pancreas 19-9 test came back 184. They wanted to scope her.  The doctor said she may not survive it.  But also said she had very little time left either way. As a family we decided yesterday that there had been enough tests and that the procedure they wanted to do was too invasive. It was time to make her comfortable. Everything has moved so fast. I’ve been next to her day and night. Listening to those guttural sounds and counting the seconds between her breaths. Cleaning out the fluids that collect in her mouth between suctions. Combing her hair. The doctor said they can’t say when it will happen but that as of this writing her lungs sound to be close to full. Family and friends have all come to say goodbye.

What should I do? Both in terms of  health, but also general life and well-being. 

I'm a 30 year old man with early signs of YOPD. Doctor says it's far too early for a diagnosis - won't even recommend me to a neurologist yet - but I am convinced I have Parkinson's. 

About 18 months ago, a friend noticed that my right arm doesn't swing when I walk. More recently, I have regular pins & needles, aching, numbness, and just an odd feeling on the right side of my body (mainly my right shoulder, arm and leg). I also often get p&n in both hands.

My suspicions were confirmed in my mind about a month ago when - after several days of stress, jet-lag and low sleep - I developed a temporary tremor in both hands, an overwhelming body fatigue and more tingling in limbs. 

Add to all this, a lot of generalised anxiety, but hard to know whether that's a symptom or just a natural response to a lot of weird stuff going on with my body!

Assuming I do in fact have YOPD, my question is: what should I be prioritising? I've already started exercising more regularly after reading that's important. Should I change my diet? 

And what about more general life stuff? Should I be prioritising travel or experiences that require mobility now? Should I be focusing on earning as much as possible now to compensate for a possible early retirement? I'm getting married next year - should we speed up the timeline for having kids? Or forget it altogether?

As some of you know, I was diagnosed with Parkinson’s March 2018 at age 23. While I was doing okay on Mirapex/Sifrol (pramipexole) 1.5 mg (.5 3x/d) and Sifrol ER .375 1x a day, this has already appeared to not be as effective for me. Thus, I wonder if I have a PD+ disease...? Or something new entirely?

Here’s something peculiar: from 30 Oct I started having these weird, brief fainting spells where my arms would lose all strength, eyes glue shut, face feel heavy and nearly paralyzed, and I’d start to fall. As it worsened and lengthened, I’d fall to the floor and be unable to muster any strength to lift my self for several minutes. If I was talking, my speech would slow and slur until I couldn’t get anything coherent out.  Here’s the kicker though: I’m aware of my surroundings (can hear and count in my head, although difficult) the whole time. I just can’t get myself to straighten up and fly right no matter indomitable my will. The heck, scumbag body? 

The fainting flummoxed the neurologists and I  was admitted in a neurological hospital for observation. My meds were changed from pramipexole to Madopar (L-dopa, 200/50- half a pill 3x w/ Sifrol ER). I’ve been having intense pain in my limbs, pretty sure due to the change. (Some of you might recall that I had previously sought advice for pain management- which is still one of my most debilitating symptom of PD- so while I hope the pain will taper off, I’d be delusional if I thought it’d go away completely.)

At one point it felt as if my chest had froze. I had to be put on oxygen because about 8 times I’d go almost 2 minutes unable to make my chest work like my body forgot or didn’t have the strength to breathe. (I even had to be spoon fed because lifting my arms would make me faint or felt like too much effort.) I was afraid to fall asleep despite crushing exhaustion because it was like I’d die in my sleep.

I’m already using a cane because walking has become such a hassle- I tend to bend in half, stomp slowly like a ballerina dinosaur, toes (both feet) curl, right leg shakes, sooo slow, and lean to the right side. I use my cane like I’m a rowing a boat.

The confusion is real, guys. When I freeze, my brain legit feels like 5 meters is impossibly far. Sometimes when I breakdance or do floor exercises (I’m well-muscled), it scrambles my brain so that when I get up I no longer have any balance and will keep falling on the floor. Speaking of muscles, my left arm is almost 3 centimeters larger despite being right handed. I’ve tried focusing on the right side only for it to weaken.

The most bamboozling sort of confusion came to light when I was doing the finger to nose exercises neurologists like to make you do. My left hand is a little show-off, honestly, but I can’t get my right hand near my face without staring at it wide-eyed. It’s arduous to get it near my face; I can’t do it without wincing like it’s going to hurt me. It makes my brain itch and forcing these exercises too much gives me quite the headache. Yesterday my friend handed me a piece of asparagus in my right hand and I stared at it like a dumbass while trying to figure out how to dip and deposit it in mouth. 

Naturally, I’m not seeking a diagnosis but I know you guys are a knowledgeable crew. Just like some direction in how to advocate for myself: already had a (normal) EEG, so maybe try MRI again? EKG/ other heart checks? My heart does pound oddly at times and my blood pressure has been all over the place: from 85-90s/50 (50 diastolic is a constant) sitting x8 to 130-40/95-100 x4 to an unbelievable 158/130(!!) laying down. Just side-effects of medication? That’s what the neurologist half-heartedly alleged.

I just wanted to share with you all a project myself and a wonderful group are currently working on that I thought some people here might find interesting.

We are making a short comedy film about a young man and his father who has Parkinson's going on a hilarious and heart-warming quest to buy a pill of ecstasy so that the dad can dance with his wife at her upcoming surprise birthday party. The film is partly based on the writer/director's own experience with his father who has lived with Parkinson's for the last 20 years and partly inspired by the documentary 'Ecstasy & Agony' made by the BBC exploring the effects of MDMA on Parkinson's, it's ability to temporarily subdue Parkinson's symptoms and the new paths of research that opened up at the time.

We are of course VERY much aware that ecstasy is a dangerous drug and it is made explicitly clear in our film and all of our publicity that we are categorically not suggesting or encouraging anyone, in any circumstance, to take illegal substances of any kind and that ecstasy is by no means a safe or recommended treatment for Parkinson's. In fact, the film is very much about the father and son's relationship and the relationship they, and those around them, have to Parkinson's - ecstasy and the idea of two rather unlikely characters going on a drug deal is just the funny vehicle for us/them to explore this.

We haven't shot the film yet but are currently raising funds to do so as well as donations to a Parkinson's research charity here in the UK. If anyone is interested in learning more about the film, contributing to the film or following us as we make it then you are more than welcome to have a look at our Facebook page: [https://www.facebook.com/efilmofficial/](https://www.facebook.com/efilmofficial/) or please feel free to send me a message :)",2019-11-14 22:38:12

So I should start off by saying my father had Parkinson’s. I’m 38 years old. For the last 10 years I’ve been constantly in my own head about getting it as well. It’s caused quite a bit of anxiety and mental anguish. I’ve also had a history of abusing recreational drugs from time to time.

About 4 years or so ago, I started to feel a slight twitch with my right big toe. This immediately gave me constant worry and anxiety. It hasn’t gone away since then. More so, the muscle on the side of my foot that is attached to the toe spasms a lot, making it look like the big toe is moving sometimes. Occasionally the smaller toes wiggle a tad as well. This seems to happen more so when I am tense, but sometimes when not (I think?).

A couple of years after that started, my right hand started to sort of cramp up and contort when I type on a keyboard. No pain. I’ve been using a mouse, most likely the wrong way, almost daily for decades so I’m not sure if this could simply be a result of that. I am aware of task specific focal dystonia, so I’m worried it’s that.

Most recently, within the last month or so, my left eyelid has been fluttering, usually only when I blink hard to test whether it’s still there. It rarely does it when I’m normally blinking. I haven’t noticed any changes in how frequently I blink nor does light or anything irritate my eyes thus far. I also stare at a computer almost daily for work, but right eye seems perfectly fine. No vision issues.

I feel like I am feeling stiff these days, but that could also be due to my lower back issues I’ve had for quite a while and simply tensing up quite a bit in order to avoid triggering where it hurts recently. My walk seems fine, arms swing when I walk, I swim, bike etc with no issues. I recently went to a chiropractor and she did notice how stuff I was, but said that’s typical for her clients. She mentioned that my right side, around my SI joint is very compressed and needs work. She mentioned that my problem area is an area that also can affect nerves that affect my feet, so I’m wondering if that could be the cause of my muscle contractions in my right foot.

Could all of these things combined possibly be a form of multi focal dystonia or simply a bunch of coincidences my mind is wanting to put together as one condition or symptoms of something more serious.

I went to see a neurologist about 5-6 months ago and he assessed me, gave me all of the physical tests for PD and said I passed with flying colours. He didn’t seem to concerned about my foot spasms and my hand cramping up while typing. My balance seems fine, bowel movements are normal, handwriting seems ok at the moment.

Any insight? Anyone experience any of this stuff? Is this all manifested due to compound anxiety about it over the many years?

Any insight would be appreciated.

He was officially diagnosed about 4 years ago, though in retrospect, we suspect he exhibited Parkinsonism for a bit longer. The initial years were mostly fine; he took the standard levodopa medication but would be able to move and do his chores by himself.

Since the last year, problems slowly began creeping up. He became increasingly unable to do some of his chores by himself (making tea, bathing, etc.). Around September this year, he began requiring assistance to lift himself up (he weighed a lot, certainly over 250 pounds. He had a fall which instilled in him a fear of moving by himself. This signaled the start of his rapid deterioration. Most peculiarly, he began complaining relentlessly of a searing pain running through his body, like needles poking him at various points (his words). According to him, the pain traversed around his body from his hand to neck to head.

We struggled a lot to figure this out. We reached out to our consulting neurologist who couldn't fully understand this phenomenon and gave a mood disorder medicine. We consulted a psychiatrist and on his recommendation, a second neurologist who suggested this could be MSA at play (until that point, we took it as being classical Parkinson's). He altered his medication a bit and prescribed a 6 week course. We frantically began reading about MSA and realized the outlook was rather bleak. This was about a week before his death.

In his final days, he had difficulty eating and stuck to semi-solid foods. He was confined to his bed and often expressed frustration at his own condition, asking us if he would ever be able to walk again. Perhaps his biggest discomfort was a constant restlessness which would cause him to repeatedly alternate between sitting, standing and sleeping. If he sat, his hands and shoulder would hurt. If we walked, he would get tired and his legs would hurt. If he lied down, his head and neck would hurt. My mother cared for him immensely and was affected the most. We all still remember him and reminisce of the times we got to spend with him.

I didn't have the stomach to write all of this but thankfully, the passage of time has helped a bit. I just wanted to share what his last days were like. He ultimately passed away due to an apparent cardiac arrest that disturbingly happened in front of me and my mother. In the end, every case could be different and it's possible (and I'm hopeful) there are many who do not have to suffer a similar fate. Thanks for reading.",2019-11-11 17:06:57

My father was diagnosed with Parkinson's when I was still in primary school. It's almost 30 years later, and he's now living in a nursing home with additional one-on-one care that I cannot provide (the home and his caregivers are fantastic).

As my mother passed a few years back, I am his only family around. However, with living 2h away and a newborn to take care of, I'm not able to see him as often as I would like.

While we speak regularly (when he actually answers his phone anyway), the conversations have degraded. He's now looking more inward, and becoming paranoid. He thinks he's being evicted, or broadly conspired against. One such conspiracy involved his old coworkers (he retired in 2000) and the provincial government. He's having trouble distinguishing between dreams and reality, or at least explaining so.

Adding to the confusion is his tendency to talk in hyperbole, and idioms. This is just him, though, not PD related.

My question is: how do I converse with him as kindly and patiently as needed? His short-term memory is nearly gone, he can't remember his grandson's name from one minute to the next. I don't want to call attention to when he forgets or confuses things, but I want to reassure him at the same time. It's hard when we have the same conversations several times a week, and nothing I say makes a dent.

Please, any assistance would be greatly appreciated. I'm at a loss.",2019-11-10 04:26:48

**Parkinson’s disease** is a long-term degenerative disease that affects the central nervous system.  Parkinson’s disease impacts different people differently. The treatment, therefore, is also highly dependent on the [type of Parkinson’s](https://parkinsons.co.in/what-are-the-types-of-parkinsons-to-watch-out-for/) that one has. Your specialist will typically recommend a treatment solution that best fits your type of Parkinson’s disease after a proper diagnosis.

**Some of the usual treatments available today to treat Parkinson’s disease are :**

1. **Medicinal or Drug-based Treatments:** Carbidopa-levodopa, Dopamine agonists, MAO-B inhibitors
2. **Surgical Treatments:** Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)
3. **Therapies**: Occupational Therapy, Physiotherapy etc.

Dad is 70, diagnosed just around 10 years ago, but probably had the disease for 11-12 years.  Currently taking Rytary ER 195mg, x3 pills 4x daily, plus Neupro patch 6mg daily, been on this schedule for at least a few years, with some minor variations here and there.

The past year has been pretty crazy.  Starting last October he started having some major impulse control issues, mostly around sex.  Extreme hypersexuality, loves being a ""sugar daddy,"" he was using multiple dating sites to find younger girls (ages 19-25), spoil them with obscene cash & other gifts in trade for sexual favors, dozens of them over the course of six months or so.  Sex toys galore - you can't open a cabinet in his apartment without a dildo or Fleshlight falling out.  At that time, he was also taking Mirapex, talked w/ his neurologist about his behavior and she removed that drug, hypersexuality starts to diminish.

Things were going OK, then starting in June or so, severe paranoid delusions and hallucinations.  Obsessively checking his online accounts and changing passwords because he thinks they're hacked.  Thinks people are breaking into his apartment and moving things around.  Thinks he has devices implanted in his body and they are altering his medications, constantly throwing his meds away and getting new ones because he thinks they've been tampered with.  I could go on and on with examples.  Eventually this culminates in him being admitted to the ICU for 8 days, then 10 more days in Geriatric psych while they dial-in some anti-psychotic medications (Seroquil, Risperdol)

He's currently in Assisted Living and they are doing full med management, which I strongly encouraged because he is \*\*really\*\* obsessive about his medications and constantly trying to micro-adjust his dosing to get more ""on"" time.  This has a tendency to really get him in trouble because he'll feel ""off"" and take way too much, then he'll be super over-medicated and jittery, crash really hard hours later.

I guess my questions are,

\- Having been with the disease for 10+ years now, given what's happening now, what should I expect?

\- I can tell he's getting really frustrated with the med management at the AL facility.  If he's due for meds at 07:30am and they arrive at 08:00am and he goes off later at 9am he assumes it was because of the poor timing and gets furious about it.  Does a half hour really make that much difference?  What about +/- 10 minutes?

\- I have observed some days, even when he had a good nights sleep and his med timing was exactly on schedule and his meals were exactly on schedule, he still has several ""off"" periods in the day.  Is this expected?

\- Any other advice you can offer?",2019-10-24 07:38:10

Doc gave me prescription of Carbidopa Levodopa... 25 /100 one tablet three times per day.

I’m starting at half a tablet three times a day.

Is 25 /100 one tablet three times per day consider low or moderate dosing?  

Before I start ramping this up I wanna be mindful of the long term effects especially as they apply to dyskinesia.

What if I just stick to half a tablet three times a day?

He has PD, Dementia and had a stroke almost 2 years ago. he has a med for sleeping as well as Melatonin. He is walking without his walker for a couple weeks now. The neurologist gave him a new med and it seems to help altho he says its because he decided he doesnt want to use the walker as a crutch.

I have been trying to keep track of his strength etc since things are up and down for him. What i've noticed is that every few weeks he will have what he calls an attack of colitis. It will sometimes pass (which I take as he ate something that his system didnt like) or he can be sick most of the day. When he has these attacks usually he will not sleep and will be in the bathroom early in the morning. It will leave him weak and he has to use his walker. Unfortunately he refuses to see his doctor. he is convinced that doctors are useless and he knows best. Other than tape him to an office chair and drag him in i cant do anything. 

So i'm wondering if intestinal trouble can be a result of the PD, is the insomnia a side effect of the PD the stroke, or both? I know that system's change as we age and perhaps he is developing a food allergy or something in his diet is off. Since I do the cooking for him he is going to a bland simple diet. Until this problem last night he had been noticable strobger and felt better the past couple weeks. Any ideas on this colitis etc?

I have boss/instructor who has been recently (I believe in the last year) diagnosed with Parkinsons. I am trying to be vague intentionally to protect this individual's privacy. It is my first interaction with this person, whom I like very much despite not not knowing him/her very well. As an employee/student interacting with this person I would very much like to give him/her a small gift around the upcoming holidays, which is something I customarily do with people I em engaged with in this position, it is just this year I will be primarily gifting this individual. I generally give alcohol to individuals I have this relationship with, although I have figured out that is not beneficial/appropriate for someone with Parkinsons. This individual has had a rough last few months and I am appreciative of his/her's general efforts and individual interaction with me. I would love to gift him/her something that would be appreciated and pertinent but not over the top in the a way that might make this individual feel uncomfortable. 

I must admit I know little about Parkinsons so I ask, what would be a gift you would like to receive if you have Parkinsons or could suggest from experience? Is there anything indulgent, like a non-alcoholic beverage you might recommend or something generally comforting? I realize this is a totally subjective question and I apologize if I seem gauche or ignorant. I know this person is struggling with side effects of their medications. I have no clue if there might be any small gift that could distract from or help with these side effects or general symptoms. 

Again, I am honestly totally new and largely unaware of the specifics of Parkinsons. I certainly don't want to seem rude or insensitive by posting such a generalizing question, it's just that this is my sole avenue at the moment. I appreciate your input and am going to do some reading on Parkinsons in general for my own education. 

Many thanks to anyone reading!",2019-10-22 13:03:25
167,Essential Tremor & Parkinson’s Disease Support Groups,tremorblog,8,dl8bv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parkinsons/comments/dl8bv7/essential_tremor_parkinsons_disease_support_groups/,0,1571726724.0,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) and essential tremor (ET) are the two most occurring movement disorders with tremors being the most noticeable symptom. Unfortunately, shaky hands lead to secondary medical conditions that affect patients’ physical and emotional lives. A recent study examined psychological complications in PD and ET patients such as depression, anxiety and social phobia, and found a high comorbidity of these disorders (1). This consequently affects personal relationships as well as limits social interaction and the ability to perform activities of daily living.

“My tremor makes me feel negative about myself; I am embarrassed about my tremor; I am depressed because of my tremor; I worry about the future; I am nervous or anxious; I have difficulty concentrating because of my tremor” (2).

It is very important to touch on such complications of PD and ET because they affect half, if not more, of the patients living with these movement disorders. On the bright side, there is a silver lining to this phenomenon. Since so many are affected by these symptoms, there is an abundance of people going through the same experiences, people who may be able to provide support in multiple forms. A study by Heusinkveld et al. showed an association between attending support groups and a better quality of life...

My grandpa was diagnosed at 68 and died at 72.  
My dad had been in a nursing home for the last 6 months following a fall he had at home.  He used his life alert and the paramedics got him.  He lost the ability to walk on his own about 3 months ago.  He started having problems talking about 2 months ago.  He’d get frustrated when the words wouldn’t come out.  Had problems swallowing about 1 month ago. All his food was purée.  He couldn’t drink water as is because he’d choke on it.  It had to be mixed with xanthan gum to thicken it up to the consistency of syrup.  Hallucinations started to get significant about 2 months ago.  They got really bad about 1 month ago.  He’d see demons, feel like he was falling through the floor, hear kids in the hallways at night.  I watched him have a hallucination and he was freaking out so bad he looked like he was having a seizure.  He entered the nursing home at 120 pounds.  He got up to 140 pounds.  Died at 110 pounds.  He had to have all his teeth removed, not due to PD but due to him not being able to care for them properly over the years.  His legs had all sorts of cuts and bruises from having hallucinations while in his wheel chair and him kicking his legs around hitting the foot guards.  It took two nurses to help him go to the bathroom using a standing lift mechanism. When they used it, it was scary that he’d look like he’d fall out of it.  About 1 month ago he started getting PD dementia bad.  He’d be ok in the morning, but would start getting confused and anxious after lunch.   Two weeks ago he had a terrible hallucination that caused him to fall out of his wheel chair and hit his head on a table requiring a emergency room visit.  A few days later him and mom met his doctor.  They decreased PD medication a lot to cut down the hallucinations.   The hallucinations decreased but his body shut down. He stopped eating and drinking completely 2 days before he died.  I think he made the right choice not to have a feeding tube. 

My grandpa had a similar decent except he died from pneumonia due to swallowing problems.  

My dad put up with much more than I think I ever could.  This week has been very rough, but I’m glad he’s not suffering any more.  I love him and I’m going to miss him a lot. 

A few other comments.  The nursing home was between $6k to $10k per month in a very low cost of living area.  My mom got nursing home insurance that covered up to $6k per month, which was a big help.  We did the most modest funeral we could and it was still $18k with the embalming, service, casket, vault, plots, and grave stone.  I should have spoken with my parents about the funeral stuff ahead of time to plan better and get competing quotes.  I feel our price was high because it was all after the fact and rushed.  We didn’t have insurance for the funeral.  If I could do it over again, I would have checked out funeral insurance or at least start planning and saving ahead of time.  

I’m happy to answer any other questions.  I’d like to be helpful since it’s my way to cope with this.",2019-10-20 23:23:16

I've had a resting tremor in my hands and action tremors in my legs since I was 16. Never thought anything of it. Then all within the last year, I've developed considerable weakness and stiffness in my left leg/arm, my tremors have worsened to the point that I can't write legibly anymore, button shirts without taking forever, etc. My leg tremors have become resting, and I can no longer sit or stand still. I also now have a noticeable back twitch and have pretty intense autonomic attacks. It became bad enough that before the L-dopa, I wasn't going to be able to live away from help for my Sophomore year at school. Considering I go to school several states from home, that meant no school for me.  

Long story short, after several weeks in a hospital bed and two surgeries later, I'm getting tested Dopa-Responsive-Dystonia. In the meantime, I was given L-dopa, and to everyone's surprise, it totally worked. It was as if I was 15 again, spry and energetic for the first time in forever. Much better tremors, no attacks, no limping, no weakness, back to normal.  

However, I tested negative for DRD on Tuesday leaving my doctors wondering why I responded to treatment. I am now getting a DAT Scan, which screams to me that I have an incoming Parkinson's diagnosis. So in an effort to be as proactive as possible and do myself a favor, I am wondering what are the big tips and strategies that I should adopt moving forward?

Just don’t use the Servo library but set the intensity from 0 to 255 via analogWrite call. 

Programmed in all the patterns I’ve seen and tried varying the pattern sequence rate. Much to my disappointment, I’ve not seen any effect whatever.  Obviously it works on Emma but does it work on anyone else?  Also my tremor is more confined to my wrist and Emma’s seems more around her fingers.  Given that my tremor stems from my flexor muscles up near my elbow, I don’t see how vibrating the wrist can affect those muscles. 

I’m working on two alternate approaches: 1) electrical stimulation and 2) mechanical compensation. Interested in sharing thoughts.

I hope you don’t mind me asking some questions! 

For anyone that attended or has every attended one of these events:

- What was missing or something that you would want to see at this type of walk/fundraiser? Would you like to see more booths, more activities going on?

- Are you more likely to attend the event or just donate to it? What causes you to prefer one over the other? 

- Any general ideas that you have that could improve the walk or our marketing efforts in getting the word out? With our donation goal not being met before the walk, we’re always looking to see what can be improved in all aspects!

It started in 2016 after I got stressed out over something. It smells like ammonia mostly but can also smell like something is burning.

This user confirmed this was still a successful part of their regime.

So I added pepper and Curcumin 3 or 4 times a day with coconut oil to my regime and within 4 days my limp was gone and   I can now tap a rhythm with my left foot on the floor.   I could not do this before hence the limp.

Oil / fat is needed to help absorb the Curcumin and pepper prevents the body breaking down the Curcumin my reading finds.

No change so far with my hand and voice, but my garmin watch now shows big improvement with deep sleep time.  The watch was previously showing max 30 mins deep sleep and now it shows over 1 hour...last night 1 hr 28 mins.  Note don’t take pepper before bed as it will keep you awake !

1. Aware in Care Kit!
2. Keep current medications in your Aware in Care Kit (rotate stock)!
3. Keep an updated list of your medications, dose, who prescribed, and WHEN TAKEN in your kit.
4. Keep a small bottle of water in the kit.
5. Make sure your admitting Physician has ""Patient allowed to take own medication"" on your admitting forms. 
6. Make sure everyone knows, ""My name is... I have Parkinson's. I need my medication on time; every time; wake me.
7. We must get up an keep moving. We get slapped with the yellow ""fall risk"" bracelet and told to stay in bed. We must get up and start moving.
8. Bring an ambulatory belt, have your kids/care partner understand how to use it to assist you in getting out of bed. 
9. Often the Hospital will ask if you want Physical Therapists to help get you up out of bed, but they may only have a PT twice a week! We need to keep moving (helps us get out bowels moving). 
10. Watch out for thickeners. To make baby food more appealing, often, it is formed to look like real food. Thickeners cause more issues of constipation. It's cement for use like Parkinson's.

Since then he's also had some other health problems including a bypass surgery in 2014 and a blood clot about three months ago. He is 67, retired, and receives social security, and my mom is 11 years younger, in good health, and could likely continue working another 15 years assuming her time is not entirely occupied by caring for my dad.  

Both he and my mom are naturalized Canadian citizens but have lived in the US the last 22 years, which is also where I grew up. As the PD and other health issues have gotten more serious, I've started to think about whether it's a viable option for them to move back to Canada, most likely Ontario where they previously lived. The primary motivation would be to simplify their healthcare situation and minimize their expenses. Financially speaking, the move would be doable. My primary concerns are how the PD care would compare.

My dad will soon transition from his old employer's private insurance plan to Medicare. They haven't been catastrophically screwed by the US insurance/health care system like some others we know, but they pay about $200/month for medication, and recently one of my Dad's primary PD medications was increased in price from about $80/month to over $2000/month. He had to go through a whole series of doctor visits over the course of about six months to switch to a different medication, and several more visits since switching to account for some new side effects. We are also not super happy with the treatment he's received so far. Even under his employer's care plan, we often wait 2+ months for an appointment with his neurologist, drive 2+ hours each way to a university hospital, only to get rushed through a 15 minute appointment with barely any time for questions and prescribed a cocktail of meds which treat the PD symptoms but cause other side effects. I predict his care will only get more expensive and involved going forward.

**So the general question is:** can anyone offer a comparison of the PD treatment process in Canada vs. the United states?

Some more specific questions:

* What kind of steps should we take to make sure he transitions smoothly in the initial 3-month waiting period for health coverage.
* Are preventative treatments like physical therapy readily accessible? This is actually something I've been pleased with under Medicare. He recently started a 3-4x/week PT program targeted specifically for PD.
* Are waiting times to see a neurologist/other specialists comparable or better than in the US? From what I've read the Canadian system treats emergencies immediately and everything else in order of priority. Where does PD treatment fall in terms of priority?
* Are there major differences in the treatment when covered by the standard Canadian system vs. buying private insurance?
* Is in-home care covered under the Canadian system? I think at some point it's inevitable he will need someone to come and help do basic things, especially if my mom continues working, which I think is important for financial stability and her general sense of purpose.

43 year old male, widower with three young kids ages 12, 10 and 8.  Lost my wife to ALS when she was 35 several years ago.   I’m average build, fairly active but spend a lot of time (I mean a lot) on computers.  I manage a fairly successful internet product.  But my health is starting to take a hit.  Needless to say this concerns me.

-Started a few years back when I noticed that my legs would get extremely tense when under stressful conditions.

-Couple years ago started feeling foot pain in both feet if I had to stand in the same spot for an extended period of time.  Concerts and sports events became a no go for me.

-Started to feel massive lower back tightness when I would get up after sitting down or laying for an extended period of time.

-This then evolved to a left foot dragging and it tremors when I get nervous.  My hands do not shake.

-Over the past few months Ive gotten to the point where both my quads are burning.  They burn so bad sometimes.  Also I’ve been dealing with a left frozen shoulder the past couple years.

-It’s difficult to walk now. It’s hard to get the first few steps going.  

However the interesting thing is that after walking for about 15-20 min I can walk much better. Not 100% but pretty close to it.  In fact, I can even run and do jumping jacks.  My left frozen shoulder also resumes to a normal swing.

Im freaking out because I’ve basically have become immobile.  My lower back is always very tight, my mid back is super tight.

I saw an orthopedic surgeon this week.  My spine X-ray and MRI was fine.  He wants me to see a neurologist and rheumatologist too.

Anyone experience the same thing?  As you might imagine my head is everywhere.

We had a diverse group for training, so I need to sit down and write up notes while thinking of them.

A couple of key points:

Medications on time, every time, ~~walk~~  wake me!

Getting up and moving is critical post-op.

You are your advocate!

Talking with Floor Nurses: Often, vitals, rounds, back to vitals is a four-hour shift. Hence if you need meds every four hours, you're in luck, but for the rest of us, they may have 15 patients to cover and near impossible to deviate. Even the ""best practice"" is medication within a two-hour window. So your Nine O'Clock meds might be administered between 8 and 10. That means your Noon meds will show up between 11 and 1. We are unique! We must advocate for ourselves to make sure we get our medication on time, every time! So that ""every three hours"" might be from one to five hours.

We must keep meds on schedule. Yes, before surgery, you're told NPO, no food nor water. Screw it, take your meds with a sip of water. TIP: Small water bottle in your aware in care kit! A small sip of water one hour before surgery is fine (ask your Admitting Physician, be polite and firm. have you and your advocate explain it is critical to our well being).

Medication: Rotate into your kit, so all prescriptions are current. Put new meds into your bag, rotate out last month into your pills.

Your Kit: Broken Hips. Where is your bag? D family/friends who know to grab it? Do Is is ready to go (read notes about meds, in one case, the person's script was six months old for Sinemet CR, so hospital said ""out of date"" and substitute Sinemet IR as the didn't stock controlled release (aka extended-release). Start adding up all the different dosing, different release, Rytary, and everything else your hospital may not stock. Some of use do not do well with Generic Versions of drugs, yet that is all they may stock.

OK, fess up, who has the kits, and they got stuffed someplace and forgotten.

Go dig them out.

Fill out your medication form. Keep that form and your pills in a clear zip-lock bag with your kit:

Paper Form (have the kids print nicely, ha!)

[https://www.parkinson.org/sites/default/files/AIC-MedicationsForm2019.pdf](https://www.parkinson.org/sites/default/files/AIC-MedicationsForm2019.pdf)

[https://www.parkinson.org/sites/default/files/Aware-in-Care-Fillable-Medication-Form.pdf](https://www.parkinson.org/sites/default/files/Aware-in-Care-Fillable-Medication-Form.pdf)

Review the content, toss in your scripts (I use a big zip lock bag with a printed Medication Form also in the kit).

Add a small bottle of water.

[https://www.parkinson.org/sites/default/files/Aware-in-Care-Fillable-Medication-Form.pdf](https://www.parkinson.org/sites/default/files/Aware-in-Care-Fillable-Medication-Form.pdf)

Be prepared!

Please share!

We spent the last two years getting out medication dialed to our needs.

One thing that came up is how often those of us are given ""fall risk"" bands.

We need to keep moving. So immediately after surgery, get your meds! Immediately!

Sooner you are up and ambulatory, the better.

In reality, what happens is you're shipped up to your room, nursing is busy! So someone checks in, but the nursing staff is 'busy. You ask to get up and walk around. The nursing staff will ask, ""would you like a Physical Therapist to help you walk around."" Oh, that would be wonderful!  What you may not realize is they have two PT's for a hospital, so your Friday Surgery means not PT until Tuesday or the Following Friday!  Once PT has been ordered, the staff is NOT ALLOWED to get up walking until PT has cleared you. Well, I need to walk and move to get my bowels to move, but you are not released from the hospital until you have had a BM.

The staff doesn't want a ""fall"" listed on their records of your stay. So get a gait (ambilitory} belt, have the kids learn how to use it and how to walk with their Mom/Dad. Then it is a family member helping them. Get their admitting Physician to write they need to be up and walking. Always check with your doc's first, but the movement is critical. Our goal is to get out of the hospital as fast as possible (less chance of infection, better food, and keeping your meds on schedule).

So if you are a ""restricted diet,"" i.e., baby food, to make it look more appealing, it is shaped to look like real food. They use thickeners to turn it into a shape that looks like a slice of pineapple. That is the last thing we need after having sedatives during surgery that slow our bowels down. Make a smoothy, not baby food with thickeners to make it look like real food.

The Parkinson's 1 800 helplines, a fantastic resource. They can not give out medical advice, but that is where all the pamphlets come from your questions. So if they don't have an answer, they will ask the good Doctor's for the best advice and get that information into the new online or printed article. Even after two days of classes, I can not remember everything, but I have a resource to use to help others.

Yes, I am still working full time. Hard to find enough hours in the day, but we need to advocate for ourselves and others for the best outcomes.

Oh, for those in San Diego, you have some fantastic resources! I thought Austin was good, but we have a long way to go.

Things to cover during my presentation:

Medication that blocks dopamine and should never be administered:

Haldol

Abilify

Zyprexa

Geodon

Prolixin

Reglan

Tremors, rigid facial expressions, and cognitive difficulties are among other common symptoms experienced by patients (Jankovic, 2008). A significant one experienced by both patients and caregivers that most people tend to overlook is the stigma that arises as a result of those common symptoms. Such a phenomenon affects everyday life and patient’s subjective and relational perception which may lead to frustration, social isolation and consequently negative health effects.

Stigma refers to the negative attitudes (prejudice) and negative behavior (discrimination) toward people who appear different from what is considered normal and accepted. This can be due to appearances or behaviours of the stigmatized person which may result in shaming, isolation and possible threatening of their personal identity.

Since many people are unaware of the physical demonstrations of PD, stigma may arise due to visible symptoms experienced by people living with PD (Hermanns, 2013). Shakiness, the inability to talk or to stand still as well as cognitive decline leads to negative misconceptions in public environments. Some patients share instances of being characterized as lazy or “looking a little slow”. A few described being mistakenly perceived as drunk due to the uncontrollable motor symptoms or the inability to complete tasks.

Stigma may also be a result of relational and communication problems. In addition to being misperceived due to...

I have developed serious gastric issues over the last few years. I am being tested later this month for Gastroparesis.

The root cause of this shakiness is due to the tiny muscle fibers found within the hands and arms that are constantly contracting and resting (Piedmont healthcare, 2017). At times this involuntary movement may become imbalanced as some of the muscle groups may continue to contract instead of entering the resting phase setting the timing off (Piedmont healthcare, 2017).

The trick here is figuring out if this shakiness of the hand is normal or abnormal (Harvard Health Publishing, 2015).

“You know your body best,” says Dr. Etienne. “If you feel shaky after a couple cups of coffee or as you prep for a public speaking engagement, it may very well be the caffeine or adrenaline causing your shakiness, and there is no cause for alarm. But if you can’t control it, even when you aren’t using your hands, this might be a sign to seek your doctor’s advice” (Piedmont healthcare, 2017).

# Causes

There are a variety of conditions that contribute to hand tremors. Common causes of shaky hands include:

**Anxiety**. Anxiety takes on a form of a psychological tremor, involuntary muscle movement occurring within the body of a healthy person resulting in mechanical and nervous system interactions (Tomczak, Gajewski, & Mazur–Różycka, 2014).  When dealing with such strong emotions, nerves are heightened causing shaky hands usually due to significant feelings of anger, stress, tiredness or being anxious.

**Lack of Sleep**. When the body is deprived of sleep it may trigger neurological reflexes that can then result in shaky hands, irritation, mood change, and lack of concentration (Piedmont healthcare, 2017).  Sleep deprivation can ...

I was out doing my morning run. Woke up at 5:50 AM, took morning meds.

Working and realized it was almost 8:00 AM, time for a run.   

30 minutes into my run, good 14 minute mile pace so a little more than two miles into a three mile run. Normal loop around the neighborhood. Hit the wall. Damn.

Just can not remain upright, felt like I was ready to fall over. Hot and Humid morning (80F 80% humidity) so it zapped me.

I did use the rescue inhaler. Pull it apart, drop in capsule, push to puncture capsule. Biggest challenge is getting the foil packet open and capsule into the mechanism. In hale.  Oh I coughed out the first dose. Repeat with second capsule. Five minutes later hands stopped shaking, legs not as stiff. Still not the 100% same as my usual dose, but will help while doing intense exercise.

Seems to work for me, now to get insurance to approve it.

220,Stage 2 trial of Nilotinib (Tasigna) suggests it slows progression of PD,11newaccount11,2,d95x7s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parkinsons/comments/d95x7s/stage_2_trial_of_nilotinib_tasigna_suggests_it/,3,1569458627.0,"Method: 

A phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of the impact of Nilotinib on safety, tolerability and clinical effects in PD. Seventy-five mid-stage PD participants (H&Y 2.5-3) were randomized 1:1:1 into placebo, 150mg or 300mg Nilotinib once daily for 12 months.

Results: 

Participants well tolerated Nilotinib and no hematological, hepatic and other systems disorders were observed. Cardiovascular events were seen in all groups. Prior to randomization all participants were stabilized on either Levodopa and/or dopamine agonists and were tested ON time. As expected, all 
3 groups were stable at 6 months, indicating the effects of PD medications. However, the placebo group significantly declined on UPDRS II (2.39 points, p=0.007), total UPDRS I-III (4.78 points, p=0.031) and UPDRS I-IV (4.47 points, p=0.038) at 6-12 months but Nilotinib groups remained stable. Similarly, all 
groups were stable on PDQ39 SI and the emotional well-being subscale at 6 months but the placebo group significantly declined (8.17 points, p=0.001 and 1.7 points, p=0.03, respectively) at 6-12 months, while Nilotinib groups remained stable.

Conclusion: 

Nilotinib is well tolerated and appears to be safe in PD patients. Nilotinib appears to stop the decline in motor and non-motor functions when the effects of PD medications wear off six months after treatment. Nilotinib may have a significant impact on the care and management of PD patients, leading to delay or elimination of dose adjustment, thus avoiding various side effects associated with PD-medications.

Anne has been hospitalized multiple times this year for episodes of psychosis related to her Parkinson's. She is always medicated and sent home.

This time, while Anne's husband was out of the hospital room, the doctor had Anne sign consent forms to be committed. Anne was actively in a psychosis episode at that time, it's why she was in the hospital in the first place.

They had Anne transferred to a care facility. The couple reluctantly agreed they wanted to get a better handle on the situation and trying this felt like the right choice. Neither understood that when Anne signed that paperwork, she gave a judge the right to decide when she can leave.

Anne is not doing well in the facility. Episodes have worsened and she has become violent with the staff. Her husband recognizes the environment is making things worse. Only today did he fully understand that they can't take her home until both the doctor and the judge agree she has had 3 consecutive days of good behavior.

I'm not sure what questions to ask you to help this family. None of us are legal folks over here. 

What fundamental legal facts of this situation should we understand?

Is there any way they can argue that she wasn't in a state of mind to consent for herself? Could they do something with power of attorney?

I work out/ go to the sauna often so I've thought it's just an electrolyte/ diet issue and I think it could be but I've been trying different things for this long to no avail. I wake with twitching / cramped calves almost nightly and some nights my feet involuntarily stick up towards my head which is painful. This happens regardless of if I've worked out/ sauna. I've noticed I am dropping things more often and have been running into doors as well as sometimes getting off balance when walking. And I posted about this before but I find myself doing a pill rolling movement with my fingers when I'm thinking of something or not doing anything. It's not a tremor but I find it odd that it's that specific movement. Any thoughts on if this could be early parkinsons? I'm 30 male",2019-09-12 20:38:27

He is getting progressively worse because for a few months he just sits in his chair all day. Only recently hes gone to his walker almost fulltime. he has balance issues and his legs get very weak. He denied PT at stroke rehab and every since. His neurologist set him up with PT but apparently they overworked him so he never went back. he is the kind of person that if he doesnt like what you say he either ignores you or just says 'no'. he thinks he knows best on everything. Yet he has refused exercise of any kind for two years and he is fast headed for a wheelchair and total loss of balance. 

I have talked to him about it to no avail but tonight he tells me he is afraid of falling. that I know of he has fallen three times. One ended in the ER and a spinal fusion. One in the driveway that split his scalp open but was ok. twice it was taking a hot shower and he walks out, it crashes his BP and he collapses. he has a very hard time standing and sitting. I explained again that his muscles are atrophying and he needs some exercise. he isnt scheduled to see his neurologist for at least a month and refuses to go early. 

So, I can outline for him a few exercises but i thought it may work better if it comes from an official source as my dda tends to always discount anything I say...like you should do your PT. Does anyone have a good source , book or video for some very very basic exercises for a man of 92 who is very weak.  PT in rehab was showing him how to do the basics, so i suggested he slowly and carefully practice standing and sitting from his chair. And when he starts to get tired rest and when he feels stronger he could do it again. he cant do too much at one time because his legs get so weak hes afraid of falling. On standing on the way up he has a hard time with balance. 

Anyway, if anyone has something just very basic would appreciate it.",2019-09-11 09:17:02

He had DBS surgery 5 years ago, which has helped a lot with his motor functions, and he still drives (though I wish he wouldn't...) and gets around with the help of a walker.  His movement can be erratic and he falls a lot, which tends to very much alarm strangers out in public (it also gives me heart palpitations, even though I've seen it a million times); he will not accept help getting up when he does.

Cognitively, he is pretty good- but in the past few months we have started to see a lot more psychosis, primarily in the forms of mania and delusion.  His neurologist adjusted my dad's meds so the mania is not as pronounced (he's not randomly breaking into song, or rambling on and on, etc.); now he's just weirdly chipper (but also prone to angry outbursts).  We all agree this is preferable to him being severely depressed, as he was before.  

But his delusions are the real problem.  He believes that he is not only doing well, but that he is continuing to get better- that he has beat Parkinson's.  He claims he is the smartest man in the world, and knows better than anyone else about pretty much everything.  He has conspiracy theories, he's constantly meddling in people's lives, etc..  He can be very mean if you disagree with him.  And he has zero boundaries, socially- he will talk to anyone about anything.

My mother also has medical conditions that have made it impossible for her to live without assistance; my dad not only has zero sympathy for her these days, he has also become cruel to her- some would say abusive.  Because of this, my mother has decided to move into assisted living.  Dad is not interested in moving, so we are stuck with the prospect of him living alone- which I believe is not safe.  

Yet, when we try to talk to him about needing to hire help so he isn't living on his own, he refuses to discuss it.  He says things like ""honey, things are getting better every day for me- don't worry your pretty little head over it!""  

So my question is:  what do we do?  He will not discuss hiring help.  He will not move into a retirement community.  But I fear that if we make those choices for him, he will be extremely angry.  I can imagine that he could be very abusive to home care workers, and is also able enough that he could simply refuse to take their help.  

Does anyone have any advice or experience with this?  I'd really appreciate it.",2019-09-11 00:56:19

Over the past year or so she’s been having some vague health complaints - fatigue, IBS symptoms, chronic runny nose/colds, etc. She mostly chalked it up to getting older. But recently she got concerned enough to go see her doctor, and now she has a diagnosis of PD. 

I’m in medicine, so I know a fair bit about PD, nowhere near as much as a neuro or MDS but I’m familiar with the disease course, symptoms and treatments. I’m upset because my MIL is a wonderful, brilliant and loving woman who doesn’t deserve this, but I’m trying to stay hopeful for her. She is quite savvy so she’s doing a lot of research and jumping right into things that we know can help slow progression. She’s starting an exercise program for PD and looking for a dietician who works with PD patients. She has a referral to a great MDS. It seems like she’s doing all the right things and is staying engaged with her care. I’m very sad about the diagnosis but I’m happy that she’s so proactive about treatment and that she has good resources.

My partner has just been flattened by this news. He’s thinking about the end stages, caring for her when she’s not capable of it herself, the dementia, watching her stop walking, all of it. He knows enough about PD to know that it’s incurable and that eventually his mother will lose her motor and cognitive function, which understandably has him absolutely devastated.

I am doing my own additional research into PD so I know what to expect and how to be a good caregiver when it does come to that, but what are some things I can do for my partner right now? Obviously lots of hugs, reassurance that I love him and will do everything I can to help, holding down the fort so he can take a trip back home. But I don’t know if it’s too soon to start putting together a resource packet for him, finding family support groups in our area, researching other activities that might be helpful for his mom, going over her new meds and what side effects to look out for, talking about PD stages. Through work I have access to good medical literature and I’m happy to do the reading for both of us, but I’m worried that it might seem impersonal or too “doctor-y”.

What are your favorite tech and gadgets for people with PD?

Here's my list so far...

She's got an Amazon Echo which is connected to Ask My Buddy. Right now, this is just one unit but I'm considering adding Echos to other rooms. Especially Echo Show. This weekend, I taught her how to use Alexa for to-do lists and shopping lists so she doesn't have to write things down. (She can't really write unless she is super up on her meds.)

She has motion sensor light strips that come on when she gets out of bed and walks around so she doesn't have to find a light switch.

She has keyless entry so she doesn't have to try to get the key in the lock.

Loves her iPad and iPhone with the assistive touch button. (She was always having trouble getting back to home on the devices that got rid of the home button.)

Got her set up with Shipt so she gets all her groceries delivered now -- she is ADDICTED to Shipt. Also proud Amazon Prime member.

LifeAlert of course but wasn't wearing it during her last fall and ended up on the grass outside in 90+ degree heat until a random guy found her. (Thank you, random man wherever you are.)  Also, she didn't bring her phone outside with her. I'm going to try to set up Siri next time so that she will respond even when the phone is unlocked but obvs she has to get used to having her phone with her.

She was diagnosed about 2 years ago but started Myrapex (spelling?) about a year ago and since the day she started it, she has delusions that my fathers is addicted to porn, having affairs, into child porn (newest delusion), keeping money from her - I could go on and on. My father is NONE of those things and never has been. In fact, he is about as caring, helpful and loving as could be. He is codependent by nature. I managed to con her into going into the psych ward at UT Southwestern in Dallas. Because of my dads “connections”, she was (and still is) seeing the head neurologist there. She is also seeing a psychiatrist at UT Southwestern . They are slowing weening her off it myrapex but I don’t know the dose she is currently on. She just lowered the dose again about a week again and is more delusional than ever. She is mad at my father all day every day but mostly at 10:00PM every single night. She harasses him and begs for answers and the “truth”  about his “addictions”. The same running theme of my moms for the past year is “if your dad would only tell me the truth”. If you didn’t know her, you would believe her stories about my dad. She had manipulated many doctors into believing this stuff about my dad. She has made him to to a psychiatrist, psychologist, and a few sex addiction doctors. He actually goes! He is so desperate to appease her but of course nothing works. He is in full on denial about her being sick and thinks he can “talk her out of” thinking this way. But he knows this and admits it. I could go on and on and on about what has happened the past year. The doctors at UT want to get her back into the psych ward for a week to get control of her meds and help with her delusions and her depression (that has gotten really bad recently but side note: she has suffered from depression and anxiety pretty much her whole life - along with an abusive father but that story is for another day. The other night, she refused to sleep with my dad and told him “ you look different “. She literally goes in and out of this delusion that my dad is a “horrible, disgusting, human being”. It is killing her because it is as real as the light of day to her, it is killing my father bc of the daily verbal abuse and the idea of loosing his wife, and it is incredibly difficult for me because I am in the middle of it. My father calls me to talk about it and I am the one person my mom feels she can trust and confide in. There’s so many other stories and important details to all of this (her not letting anyone help her with her meds even though we all know she isn’t taking this correctly every day, the fact that if anyone where to meet her today face to face, you would have no idea she could have these delusions because she appears shocking “normal” when she needs to, hiring a lawyer and literally took him out of her will...) We need help. How can this be happening in my parents lives everyday and no one can help us. My father and I have called her doctors and psychiatrists and therapists so many times with our concerns but nothing is changing. My mother is stronger and more defiant than she has ever been in her life. She told the neurologist when she was in the psych ward 6-8 moths ago, “I will go to my grave believing Nic is a porn addict” and she will. I don’t want to settle. We need help now. Or is my mother so sick and we are both in denial? When and who says they need to hire a caregiver? Go to a home? There had got to be a medication that can help with this. Is this the best Parkinson’s meds can do because she was pretty well off besides shaky hands and stiff legs UP UNTIL my mom was diagnosed. I don’t even know what I am saying at this point except this FUCKING sucks and it hurts really bad. My father had already had a heart attack. I will loose both parents if something doesn’t change.

Was told by first neurologist is was psychogenic (definitely!).  A challenge with (25/100 x2/day, seems light) levodopa/carbidopa from the second neuro seems to have done nothing for tremors, but she did think ""Parkinsonian"".  The third- an MDS with an odd, controlling bedside manner (talked to others in town, ""yeah, she's not for everyone"")- was adamant after a single exam that I had PD.  I'm not 100% sure and I'm not totally confident in this MDS.  But nor am I dismissing her.  But one viable Devil's Advocate theory is I went shopping for a diagnosis, found a quack, drama'ed up psychogenic symptoms, and here we are.

At first the higher dose (like 3x more than before), symptoms seemed to change, but then stress happened and I kinda seem to revert.  This does seem to go back to the psychogenic interpretation by my logic, and either/and observer bias/placebo were making a bad call (it happens).  I live alone and have no lay third party to give me feedback here but I do keep a diary at least.

We're all well aware there's no objective test for PD any MDS can use.  An MRI ruled out lesions and neuro #2's blood tests were unremarkable.  

If this is a misdiagnosis, that's pretty serious to take levodopa for years (or for the rest of my life) unnecessarily, and I don't understand how we would ever know.  Stopping suddenly on my own to see what it does and get my bearings is not a meaningful nor safe thing to do (duh), nor would it mean much, as cessation will cause symptoms, even if the levodopa was never helpful to begin with

I do have some recommendations on alternate MDS in town.  The riddle is, how do we approach this, already being on 5x 25/100 + 195ER?  A new MDS has no frame of reference.  Seems like low symptoms=the meds are working or ""you never had PD"", significant symptoms still existing= you totally need a higher dose or ""well you never had PD because levodopa didn't stop it"".  

I'm a bit baffled.  First neuro's psychogenic call was ""because"", MDS's PD was ""definitely... just because"".  I do see some unreasonability to demand a full criteria of why ether diagnosis was made, and if psychogenic, can easily cause inadvertent adaptation.  And I'm unclear on the expected schedule/criteria of improvement with levodopa, if it ""works"".  That leaves me in a Kafkaesque mindf*ck limbo indefinitely.

SO wish there was an objective test.  I can accept psychogenic, weird though it may be, it's better prognosis than PD long-term, although ""better/worse"" is irrelevant to fact.  How can we ever sort this out, factually, with no objective test?  This... this is what going crazy feels like",2019-09-05 15:27:48

I live in a different country and every time I call him he seemed frustrated that he had to exercise and meet so many doctors. 

Today he finally opened up and shared that he was embarrassed to go out and meet people. My dad retired as  a CEO of a fairly large company about 8 years ago. Now. He even feels embarrassed to address a meeting of 150 owners in his apartment complex. ( he is the president of the owners association). 
Couple of weeks earlier I connected him to a friend who needed him for a short freelance project. He has done many such projects in the past and he refused saying he was not particularly interested in the project subject. I now feel it could be because of the tremors. 

He is not the type who likes to listen to others and I tried talking to him about it. I also told him that he needs to take responsibility for his well being and we can’t do much. 

I was wondering is there any book anyone can recommend for him to read to get some inspiration about people who have managed the disease well? I feel like it might inspire him to take control and live his life. 
 
He is pretty stubborn but I have seen him change his mind when he reads something- I just need him to try and start taking ownership and being 100% involved in his well being.",2019-09-04 14:21:03

She thinks that she has become useless, and is getting increasingly depressed but isn’t open to talking to anyone as she’s used to dealing with emotions entirely on her own. Anytime I try to broach the topic of her getting help, going to a support group, or picking up some meaningful hobbies, she gets very upset and says I don’t know how hard she’s already trying. 

As someone with depression, I know that most everyone else can’t see the tremendous amount of strength needed to just get through the day. I’m sure it‘s beyond awful to think about the disease’s progression and its eventuality. Tonight she told me that she wished euthanasia was legal in my country. 

I don’t know what to do. It seems like anything I try makes her more upset, but I can’t just stand idly by. Her diet is really not ideal and she refuses to exercise, but even gentle suggestions to adjust her lifestyle can send her into a tailspin. It doesn’t help that there aren’t (or I can’t find) any good programmes like Rock Steady Boxing in my country to even suggest. 

I’m sure she’s trying very hard, and I don’t want to discount any of her efforts at all. I’m just wondering if there’s more I could do or some way I could be there for her without upsetting her. She is such a strong woman who has spent her entire life taking care of her family. I just wish we could do the same for her.

TLDR; mom is depressed but not open to seeking help or making lifestyle changes. Would appreciate any advice on how best to speak about PD with sensitivity, and any suggestions on alternatives if you live in an area where programmes and support groups aren’t readily available. Any input would be greatly appreciated.",2019-09-04 01:03:42

A few specific questions:

* Am I correct in understand that if he gets disability, he'll receive the disability amount until he becomes 70 and hits full retirement age at which point the retirement amount will switch to the larger, full retirement amount?
* Can my sibling, as POA, file for my father's disability?

The latter means he thinks he knows better than anyone else and will only do something if its his idea or someone he sees as in authority reccomends it and he approves. He had a stroke a couple years ago and refused to co-operate in rehab and hasnt  done any physical or mental therapy since. I have tried since he first went into rehab  to get him to exercise and have talked blue in the face telling him how important it is and how it will get if he doesnt. Well sadly Life has proven me correct. he has a hard time walking and almost always uses a walker now. he sits in a chair in the darkened room all day and watches TV. He has almost no strength in his legs and sitting down is more of a fall into the chair. I told him a couple weeks ago that he needs to walk around the house every day, even if its with the walker, nope.

He also has trouble sleeping so he has a sleep med. Plus melatonin. The last few nights he sleeps about 3-4 hours and thats it, which makes him weaker. Ive talked with him about the need to get some exercise and some light. he needs to have a light on during the day. my brother even suggested getting the bulbs that produce light like sunlight. But all dad does is sit in the dark room and watch TV.

My Mom passed a year ago April. A couple weeks prior she had told me she still loved dad dearly and I promised to take care of him. Both my parents have always been vehemently opposed to being put in a home. Dad doesnt need a facility as he can do something about his issues. But anything that comes from me he refuses. its like his narcissism locks him into failure. he has to figure out for himself what the problem is and thus find a solution. but he doesnt know enough about the issues.

289,Questioning diagnosis,nearfar47,3,cwfit5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parkinsons/comments/cwfit5/questioning_diagnosis/,3,1566993226.0,"So I've been to 2 neurologists who said my unilateral leg/hand shaking/stiffness at 47 was not Parkinsons.  Micrographia (my writing hand has the prob).  No balance probs, no falls ever, no constipation, no speech, neck or swallowing probs.  Some weight loss, not eating as much TBH.  We did try Sinemet 25/100 2x/day anyways (because why not, it can only answer questions), but no response in a week.  A few months later I did try it again for a few days, again, no response.  I'm counting about 35 tablets used total.

I keep a detailed diary and tracking symptoms and what I've tried are like 3/4 the text.   Amplitude of tremors does vary but I'm looking for a pattern and sinemet 2x/day did not seem to show any net result, and it won't work for a psychogenic tremor, thus backing the original ""well, whatever it is, it's not Parkinson's"".

Followed up with second neurologist (who'd said psychogenic or ""Parkinson's-Plus"") with MRI and blood tests which showed nothing remarkable but she thought it was ""Parkinsonian"" and referred me to a specialist.

Well this 3rd neuro was strange.  Her bedside manner was jarring (looked up some Google reviews for kicks and I wasn't alone) and straight ""you have Parkinsons"" and soon brought up DPS implants.  I wasn't trying to argue for one thing or another but I did point out that other neurologists had said psychogenic/conversion and sinemet did not seem to work and was flat cut off with ""well, \*they were wrong.\*  You. have. Parkinsons.  You've had it for at least 5 years now.""  I didn't get much for justifying logic and that's what I was looking for.  I can accept that if it's fact, but fact is sinemet didn't do anything previously, not at the dose tried.  In fact I was cut off most times I brought something up, and not on things that were drawn out/rambling.

I was upfront about some light benzo usage for sleep (omg works so well), tianeptine as as antidepressant/antianxiety (not approved in USA, owned by a French pharma company, but a lot of people report good things, including me), clomiphene (for low testosterone) and FS CBD oil (which, honestly, doesn't seem to do anything for me).  None of which correlates with onset of these symptoms, though.  Now I'd expect a neurologist to be leery of the first two.  This was pretty condemning of all, though, including absolutely condemning the CBD oil which surprised me.  Also that my \~375  ml of red wine in PM I needed to stop or cut back.  I did mention I stopped the wine, and alternately clomiphene, for a few weeks with no difference.  There was a weird, repeated ""don't lie to me"" that kinda yellow-flagged this professionalism.  I volunteered all this info totally upfront, I was not grilled for this info.   It was feeling controlling.   The thing is, that doesn't automatically mean their info is wrong, I'm abrasive at times myself.

Was also told weight loss would be from the tremors using up extra energy.  Which, afaik, is not the way that works, but I'm not the doctor here.

She dismissed that sinemet 25/100 2x/day not doing anything, and said these things ""can take 6 weeks to build up and work"".  This contradicts what I've heard, that if it's going to respond it will within hours but only last part of a day, and I did it for over a week.  She prescribed sinemet starting 3x/day+195mg nighttime ER, progressing to 5x/day+195mg ER.

I do plan to try this regime, don't get me wrong.  I can do that higher dose and it's just more answers.   But does this even make sense?  Does it take weeks for sinemet to ""build up""?  Rather, I hear the prob is it only raises dopamine for a few hours, the prob is it \*doesn't\* soak in and build up long term.   Will it really take 6 weeks to get a response or is that bs and drawing out a no-response scenario?

Some years ago, I read that green tea was good for extending the effectiveness of Parkinson's medication and gave it a try.  It made little, if any, difference to me and I abandoned it because I was not that keen on the taste.  Times have changed and there are a greater variety of green teas available on the internet, you can even buy green tea sourced from a single acre plot in China or Japan.

In the past few weeks or so, I have been brewing my way though a selection of tea samples and have been surprised by their effect. Before, I was frequently taking two tablets of Stanek (generic Stalevo) overnight to get me through to 6.00am when my usual medication regime starts.  Now, I only need one tablet overnight.  During the day, I think green tea has extended the effectiveness of my medication by about 30 minutes every 3 hours, which is worth a great deal to me.

I am having great success with Japanese green tea,  I can get about three mug-sized  infusions per 6 grams of tea, though this can obviously vary from one tea to another.

I wish you well.",2019-08-24 17:35:38

She's not in the greatest shape physically and often complains of dizziness. Within the last 5 months she has fallen at home a couple times and just yesterday she fell while attempting to get out of a car and scraped her knee up pretty badly. Her go-to choice in footwear for the last 5+ years has been Crocs. I've always been skeptical about the actual support they provide and have even wondered if they could possibly contribute to her falling due to poor traction and looseness on the foot. I also realize that she wears them mostly out of convenience, as there's no way for her to bend over and put on/lace up a normal pair of shoes.

Are there any Croc alternatives out there for adults with balance issues that offer the same slide-on ease of use yet offer more traction and support? I've done countless Google searches and found mostly shoe sites with ""top 3"" lists, but I'd like to perhaps get feedback from someone who has possibly been in the same situation with a senior adult that is balance challenged.

I’ve gone through the trials I could find and none currently seem to be accepting new patients. I’m most interested in the next phase of PD01A whenever that begins. 

I’ve tried contacting some of the research labs directly via email but only a couple responded. 

Firstly, what resources should I be using to see upcoming and open studies so we don’t miss them?

Secondly, does anyone here have any personal or close experience with Parkinson’s vaccine or knowledge of them and the risks of this avenue?

Seems like most have been relatively safe enough but it’s not clear how effective they are from my reading. And we might have to travel to other countries and she’s approaching the upper bounds of some of the age limits.

Fall asleep in the middle of tasks and there is no stopping it, but it isn't frequent enough to seem like it is honest narcolepsy. Waking up in the morning it can take a half hour before I can really move, and I'm always so slow all of the time. I talk quiet and monotone. I used to be a rambunctious center of attention, and now I come across as shy and reserved. This isn't depression. I'm socially anxious, to the point of phobia even, and I used to be the most outlandish and outgoing person.

Last year, my sister, my husband and I noticed a decline in his cognitive and motor skills. We were worried about a minor stroke related to his diabetes but his tests came back negative. He has had a limp since foot surgery years ago. 

My parents did a cruise with aunts and uncles back in June and a fellow passenger noticed his symptoms and suggested that he should check for Parkinson’s disease. (A note: I heard this from my COUSIN this past weekend, who heard from her father. My parents neglected to tell me back when I visited them July 4, and only my mother talked to me when I saw them yesterday.)

His symptoms are imbalance, one sided gait and tremors, slow reaction, shuffling, hunched back, sleep apnea. Maybe I’m imagining a blank expression in my wedding photos back in 2017? He can still bark at me and my mom, no problem lol

I know we can’t diagnose and we just have to wait until he finally sees a neurologist in September. I just hope they sell their restaurant ASAP and retire.

I have found numerous resources and studies indicating that MDMA, as well as numerous psychedelics (including LSD and DMT) have major potential in treatment Parkinson's. MDMA directly stimulates the regeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. This same effect has been observed in users of LSD, psilocybin, DMT, and other psychedelics (including mescaline). It is thought to be a commonly shared effect amongst the psychedelic class of drugs in general.

In 2001, the BBC television programme “Horizon” ([http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2000/ecstasyagony.shtml](http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2000/ecstasyagony.shtml)) featured a 34- year-old man who had been diagnosed with young-onset PD. The man was being treated with levodopa but like many, he suffered from induced dyskinesias. The man explained to scientists at the University of Manchester how he had taken an ecstasy tablet on a night out and had inadvertently experienced enhanced motor performance. To disprove the “placebo effect” a two-day double blind study was set up. Comparisons of the two days were conclusive, in that ecstasy made his movements smoother and less disjointed with the absence of dyskinesia. Movement was so improved that after 90 minutes following ingestion, he could be seen to perform back-flips and somersaults (he was formerly a movie stuntman before diagnosis), thereby abolishing the “placebo effect” suggestion. Investigations were conducted and brain scans showed no changes in DA levels in the man’s brain, following ecstasy ingestion. Parkinsonism relief was greatly enhanced when ecstasy was used in conjunction with levodopa.

Similarly, Channel 4 screened a programme in August 2006 which featured a man named Michael Gibson ([http://www.channel4.com/health/microsites/0](http://www.channel4.com/health/microsites/0-)9/4health/body/ill\_parkinsons\_shookup.html). Diagnosed with PD at only 18 years old, the programme showed him state that taking ecstasy relieved his symptoms of PD.

Further evidence supporting this beneficial therapeutic effect has been confirmed by New Scientist, ([https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn3015-ecstasy-has-dramatic-effect-on-parkinsons-symptoms/](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn3015-ecstasy-has-dramatic-effect-on-parkinsons-symptoms/)) including animal studies in which dopaminergic neuronal density increased in the brain following ecstasy administration.

A neurologist's self-reported treatment of PD with MDMA is also documented here:  [http://tech.gaeatimes.com/index.php/archive/ecstasy-amphetamines-reverses-parkinsons-disease-in-study/](http://tech.gaeatimes.com/index.php/archive/ecstasy-amphetamines-reverses-parkinsons-disease-in-study/)

My dad has Young Onset Parkinson’s, he was diagnosed at 40. He’s 57 now, and my mom just told me she wants me to help convince him to get DBS.

I started researching it and I’m sort of getting depressed and confused here. She is his main caretaker and I know he relies on her a lot, but I also don’t want to support this decision and then lose my dad. Again, any info or experience with Deep Brain Stimulation is welcome.

He had a stroke nearly two years ago and he got his PD diagnosis in rehab. They focused on the rehab so didnt approach the PD and his doctor has never addressed as far as I know. I've only been back in town 3 years so whatever went on beforehand is unknown to me. My dad had been seeing a neurologist and getting medication and trying diff ones and diff dosages. 

He has tremors....mostly hands and arms, some slight head. he shuffles badly when he walks and has a hard time of it now most days. His speech is mosyly normal tho he is starting to stutter at the beginning of sentences. And at times he is very quiet whereas normally he would join in conversation whereas at other times he does talk alot. he is also a narcissist so if he isnt at all interested in what you're saying he acts as if you aren't even in the room.

He didnt do any physical rehab after his stroke nor did he do any at home nor does he do any exercises. yet he cant understand his deteriorating physical condition. I've suggested til i'm blue in the face that he get some exercise daily instead of just plopping into his chair and i've explained how that is a big contributor to his physical demise....its as if i'm not even there. 

So he has good days and bad days. He will feel good and have some strength for a few days to a week. Then days like today he got up at 9am and felt very weak so he went back to bed. Good days he walks on his own and bad days he's on the walker. Of the different meds he has tried none worked very well for his tremors. He  refuses to understand that his PD med is for more than just tremors. So he stopped taking his med. The problem with a narcissist is that they have to be in control. They know everything and judge everything. If they dont believe something then for them it isnt true, no matter the reality. He never saw the benefit of exercise so he didnt waste his time on it. meds didnt solve his tremors so he doesnt need them. He thinks that all he has to do is take a pill and it all goes away. he doesnt accept that it isnt about making it go away its about slowing it down or stopping it or making it a little bit better.

between the PD the slight dementia and whatever else hes dealing with its impossible to separate the causes. I went through a time where I was intensely frustrated from his refusal to listen and try to understand. You cant get through to someone who knows it all. So I no longer advise or oversee. 

What is my purpose here today, sorry that I vented. I wanted to ask about the weakness. Is this a normal PD symptom/effect? Any suggestions on something other than meds that he can try? I may be a bad son but i'm no longer willing to fight with and for someone who refuses to listen. But if there is something else that can be done? I fear this cycle is going to only get worse until the weakness is too great.

I had that procedure done at Simon Med Imaging. Why would both neurologists be anti an independent imaging center? My new doctor said that I should have ONLY gotten an DaTscan from the University of Arizona. Well... she works for the UofA because Banner and UMC are affiliated. 

Both neurologists seemed to act like using an imaging center isn't as good as a prestigious center and only an expert that only does DatScans should do the procedure and read the results not some ""common radiologist,"" as she said.

Just wondering if anyone here has a parent or loved one with Parkinson’s dementia with an issue with lasting power of attorney. My mum and I enacted one for my dad (18 years of PD, diagnosed with Pd dementia last Christmas) and he is wanting to revoke the lpa because he feels he had to consulted for it to be enacted (not the case....he gave his permission when he signed the documents years ago) It’s a very long story which I can elaborate on but just trying to gage if there is anyone else out there in a similar situation or might have some advice!!! 
We lost mum my to cancer recently as well so I am caring for my father alone at 29, with my brother living abroad. 
Dad is making life very difficult by accusing me of not acting in his best interests and although he’s been assessed as not having ‘full capacity’ to make financial decisions, he still believes he should be in charge! 

I should add that I have contacted the office of public guardian about this and they have put an alert on his file that should they receive a revocation form from him (I am not stopping him attempting to revoke it....if he could manage to go through the process correctly, which I doubt) that they would require proof from a medical professional that he has been assessed as without full capacity. So I have tried to cover all eventualities to safeguard what my brother, myself and the doctors feel is in his best interests.

I’m doing my best to care for my dad and involving him in as many decisions as possible, unless it is something he is not managing to understand and I pass it all by my brother...but it’s becoming extremely stressful, especially as well as losing my mum, who worked so hard to take of him that she forgot to take care of herself!! It is heartbreaking to care so much and essentially be told that I’m not caring....or at worse, taking advantage or ‘playing a game’ to get power!!

Pd dementia has really exaggerated some of my fathers worst personality traits and it is very painful to see and live with. In his mind the pd doctors are not qualified enough to assess him and when I ask him who is, the answer is either a silence or the latest was ‘an accountant’.
Apologies for the waffling.....I could go on for longer! Just wondering if there is anyone else out there with a loved one fighting against their family in this way?",2019-07-27 05:41:24

He apparently has had it for years and why his doctor didnt notice I have no clue. Dad still gets around altho he shuffles his feet and is bent over. After his stroke he couldnt sleep so he takes a sleep med. So the question is....he has good and bad days. Some, like today, he feels so weak he is using his walker and barely gets around. Mom passed a year ago and he stopped taking his P meds a couple months ago. Under the meds he had slight to medium hand and arm tremors. Now they are worse and at times his hand will shake pretty well. he used to build balsawood plane models but cant thx to the tremors. 

He is usually weaker in the morning and gets stronger as the day progresses. he refuses to go see his doctor and his neurologist because he thinks they cant do anything. Since rehab he refused PT or pretty much anything to help himself. He is a narcissist and is convinced he knows better than anyone, period. He has decided nothing will help so he refuses.  he also has a history of lieing and manipulation.  I dont get him because he will complain about his condition and when i try to explain it he will disagree with whatever i say just to disagree. And he doesnt want to try and do a thing about it.

Anyone have any ideas on why some days he is so weak? I was amazed when i found this Reddit and all these people actually listening to their doctors and working towards doing something to help themselves.

**7/3:** My mother is admitted to hospital for UTI, dehydration. Her condition is fair (for her) going in. Over the next couple of days (she was in the hospital for three nights -- this comes into play later) hallucinations and rambling become the norm. Prior to this stay we have never experienced this behavior with her and the staff says it is very common in seniors with UTIs (I had no clue). She is discharged with orders to finish antibiotic (though she was on a preventative antibiotic) and is cleared to begin PT the following week. MRI/CT scan/ultrasounds all come back fine and no signs of a stroke, etc.

Now we're home/have been a couple of weeks and the confusion/rambling has returned off and on. We were told by the internist this behavior could persist for up to three months.

We have had issues with her mobility (thanks to all of those who answered my post -- we went to the hospital/it's been a ride so apologies for not responding sooner but TY so sooo much!) before but this bout of hallucinations/rambling is far worse to see.

My father just retired in May and has seen her change so much in such a short period he is beside himself poor man. He is in good shape but the emotional and physical toll are a lot and rn I am still working, so hopefully tomorrow when we see GP (who admitted her on 7/3) we will have order for part-time homecare since she is also in therapy. Has anyone used the 100 day benefit home care from Medicare -- if so, how did it go? I am in Houston, Texas if anyone has recommendations and we likely need someone about 3x a week just to keep us sane. 

Does anyone have experience with this and did the senior indeed 100% return to their baseline months down the road?

**TL;DR: Mom w/ PD had UTI, post-hosp/treatment still has hallucinations/rambling; has anyone seen this totally heal after a few months?**

He is not able to stand even with assistance so he has to go to another facility. We feel that he will get more attention and the help he needs at home (due to the dementia).

So, a bit of background out here. I began to have sudden onset fasciculations around September 2018. In November/December 2018, I developed a tremor in right hand and lower jaw. Both tremors are extremely fast and don't interfere with anything. I also have some quick limb fatigue. I have learned about BFS, but could not find any literature about jaw tremor. My readings all discuss Parkinsons. 

I visited a few neurologists, and no one was concerned. They gave me the ""Enhanced Physiological Tremor"" diagnosis. One neuro thought my jaw tremor was in my head since I am young (31), and couldn't see it. By the way, I do sometimes feel an internal tremor, my legs twitch/vibrate sometimes at night, and in general, I do have some muscle pain.

I was not sick with anything prior to this, nor did I suffer from any incredible stress.

Question to everyone: Does anyone have a jaw tremor, and if so, how fast is the vibration? My vibration is FAST. Like very fast shivering. I'm not sure if this is a looming sign of something sinister, or could be benign. I can't find a single source of a benign jaw tremor on the Internet besides Parkinsons. 

Since January 2019, I have not noticed a progression of any sort. A gentle plateau. The tremors are a bit better, but persist. Still get limb fatigue when walking or using my arms, but no weakness.  


Note: I am not looking for a diagnosis. Neurologists in Manhattan are not concerned, but I do think about it in the back of my mind.",2019-07-19 05:12:55

Always has been even before the PD.  Apparently she did not do well on this medication, sweats and the whole 9 yards.

&#x200B;

My mom has been in and out of hospitals for the last few days, but Monday night. Monday night. 

Listen up kids, there's a story.  This is the second different hospital she went to, because the one she normally goes to decided her previous visit was a psychological distress issue instead of a drug interaction. (Plot twist, they never asked) They were trying to get me to agree to a psych hold for her there. Ugh.

&#x200B;

According to my mom, she was treated well medically at 2nd hospital. Dr asked her the whole hey are you taking any new medication spiel.  Her caregiver was the one that brought her to this hospital and I was out of the loop till the following day since this happened at night and I'm usually in bed early for work. My grandmother is a godsend and also helps out, so in this case all of this comes from my grandma.

&#x200B;

My mom was dosed with a high dose of benadryl and some other steroids to counter the issue she was having with the Rytary.  This knocked her out and she didnt have any of her former PD med on her; so she had gone 5+ hours without her medication even though she was asleep.

According to my mom, she gave the hospital clear instructions to call my grandma to pick her up, just in case since she knew I was asleep.  

&#x200B;

My grandma told me she called the hospital prior to calling to ensure they didn't go ahead and admit her, which they've done before with this exact scenario. (PD medicine being a trial and error. :( ) 

&#x200B;

She was told she was discharged and sent home on a cab.

Alone.

At night.

&#x200B;

So, my grandma is thinking okay... I'll go check on her. She goes to my mom's house and finds her not there.  

Obviously started freaking out and was calling for my mom, mija,mija where are you?  She was fearing that she fell somewhere cause she had a bad night. 

&#x200B;

My grandma did not locate my mom, so she went to the hospital where she found my mom in a wheelchair outside by herself. 

&#x200B;

My mom was slouched over unconscious with her purse and night bag on her lap in a wheelchair at midnight! ALONE. 

&#x200B;

She didnt even know she had been discharged when I talked to her the next day since my grandma called me at work to tell me what happened.  I am SO FURIOUS. I do not CARE that they treated her and found no reason to admit her. I DO NOT.  I am furious that they put her in an unsafe environment!  What if she had been assaulted? She can't defend herself. She had to be taken home in an ambulance cause she was so out of it.  My grandma had the decency to ask the ambulance people to check her BP which it was apparently 160/90. 

LIKE WHAT THE HELL.

Im so exhausted. I am. I truly am. My mom doesnt want to be sick. She just wants to feel better.  I can't do anything for her.

But holy hell am I going to raise  every alarm there possibly is about this unsafe discharge.

If she was assaulted, I definitely would be in jail right now instead of writing on reddit.",2019-07-18 01:59:41

Is there a life expectancy? What kinds of complications could he have? He seems to be doing ok with taking the meds he's told and trying to keep 'active'. He still plays poker with his friends once a week.

I'm puzzled to why I don't hear much about it considering that fact I have read studies that in mice who did a three day fast and did 4 days of refeeding on a regular basis each week that they faired better than those mice who did not do the fast in both symptoms aswell as the protein build up in their brains? 

 I've also read information saying that autophagy could be detrimental or it could be essential in people with parkinsons.

Does it make the medicine work less good? Does it make the Parkinson's symptoms worse? I'm not a huge drinker anyhow, one or two a month at most. I don't mind giving it up, but I was wondering about other peoples experiences. I want to have it very clear in my mind if I'm a teetotaler now so I can explain it right to people.

My friend is so great, but she lives in another state. She's a veterinarian and talked to me a lot about Parkinson's and that she thinks she saw signs of it in me back in high school. It was such a relief to have a friend know what is going on with me without me having to explain too much, we haven't been talking a lot lately. 

And I have an appointment with a MDS for August 1st =) Not the best reviews online, but I'm hopeful they will be a better fit than the first neurologist I saw.

I do need to get better/more regular at taking my medicine. My husband took days off for the 4th and has been letting me sleep in until 11am. I want to be up and taking my pill at 9. When I start teaching in the fall I probably won't take it until morning recess at 9, but I might take it when I wake up at 5:30-6:00ish. I'm not sure how to manage taking it between home and work. I get busy and space out on things so I will be setting an alarm.",2019-07-08 07:56:36

It affects my leg at rest only.  My left hand often has resting tremors but gets stronger- and slow movement- when using it.  I'm 47 white male, I do not fall down, no constipation or ED.   Swallowing, speaking, urinating, and facial expression are fine, but I am understandably clumsy with that left hand and a have a slight loping gait and unusual wear pattern on my left shoe heel.  Not overweight but poor muscle tone, been that way all my life.  Slowly lost a significant amt of weight over the last 2 yrs but was not specifically trying.  Blood pressure is always on the low side, pulse commonly a bit high.  Maternal grandmother had vascular dementia in her mid 70's.  I recently met someone with Parkinsons and he was sure I had it, as the symptoms seemed dead-on.  I did not know anyone beforehand that I could have subconsciously started mimicking.

&#x200B;

It is always prominent when talking to people but also just sitting  at the computer.  It's present right now as I type.  It goes away as I settle down to sleep and mercifully does not bother my sleep.

&#x200B;

However, 2 neurologists were clear this was \*not\* Parkinsons, due to ""distractability"" and some other features.  This led to an odd line of questioning as to whether I'd been molested as a child (nope).  However we did try levidopa/carbidopa because why not.  25/100 2x 3 times per day.    It did nothing.  Tried for like a week.  I do drink a couple glasses of wine per night but I did quit for about 3 weeks straight just to see.  No difference.  I tried ""full spectrum CBD oil"" (because why not) but did nothing.  Pramipexole just made me nauseated but did nothing else.

&#x200B;

This is leaving me in an odd, difficult place.  It's somewhat debilitating  am finding very little about this condition, I see the term ""Atypical Parkinsons""/""Parkinsons Plus"" but it's not much more than a name.  It doesn't have clear diagnostic criteria, no meaningful theories on the actual mechanism of pathology, nor any clear treatment.  But I am going back to the neurologist, which admittedly I gave up on too soon before.

**Parkinson's Treatment Report**

[https://www.parkinsonstreatmentreport.com](https://www.parkinsonstreatmentreport.com)

&#x200B;

The page is non-commercial, no advertisements, no donations, no blog spam, and links are collected from trusted sources (e.g. PubMed, Google Scholar, ClinicalTrials.gov, scientific journals, mainstream news outlets, etc). Updated daily, or whenever relevant links are found. Current version shows most recent months of articles, mostly, but that will extend with time. I'll probably add a cutoff at most 6-months, but it will depend on what people prefer.

&#x200B;

Feedback and feature requests welcome, any ideas to make it more useful. This page is for the Parkinson's community here on reddit and elsewhere... patients, caretakers, family members, loved ones, doctors, researchers... basically, anyone who wants to keep up with potentially promising treatment option news, research, clinical trials, etc... and if that includes you, then I'd love to get your feedback so I can improve the page with your comments/suggestions. I will respond to every comment/question here.

&#x200B;

Also, I should mention that I do not have Parkinson's. And if you look at my post history, you'll see I've made other sites like this. This all started when I was trying to keep up with tinnitus research, and built an automated system/bots that could do all the legwork and help me keep up with the latest info. Anyway, after I shared the page I made with a few people in the tinnitus community... and got some positive feedback... I posted it to the tinnitus subreddit... and got around to thinking... why not  ""copy+paste"" my system for other conditions and communities. Not just tinnitus and a couple others, which I made for myself. So that's what I'm doing. Parkinson's is my most recent project. And my goal is to roll out pages like this one for 100+ chronic health conditions... which are not yet cured... and after that, hopefully a long list of rare disease-specific pages for those small patient communities that are underserved and left on their own to keep up with research. I want to make it easy to keep up with what's around the corner.

&#x200B;

Worth repeating, the site is non-commercial and I have zero conflicts of interest to declare. It's 100% independent, neutral,  and for the people. The ""selfish"" upside, and what will allow me to hopefully keep these sites running (all paid for out of pocket), is this... When I first began sharing some of these pages back in January... It wasn't long before people in larger organizations/companies reached out to me and expressed interest in custom ""research gathering"" solutions for their own needs. In other words, I build pages tailored to their interests, for internal use. So, in other words, my sites (including this one for Parkinson's) are a growing list of non-commercial *proof-of-concept* and *demo* pages for my underlying solution. Which I can use for other industries/niches too. And that, for me, is win-win. I get to help patients and do work that's meaningful, and while I'm doing that.... .. I'm getting enough attention and paid work to cover the expenses. I'm mentioning all this because, when I contacted /u/ParkieDude asking if I could share the page, he said I might want to give some background. So that's the gist of it... and, of course, if you have any further questions just post them here and I'll do my best to answer.",2019-07-03 01:21:47

So I [28M] have a really good relationship with my grandmom [86] and lately she is having a lot of tremors and she feels terrible and it makes me so sad to see her this way.

My granny is taking medicine for quite some while, I think around 6 years. I go to the doctor with her everytime for the usual checkup. However, lately the doctor has increased her dosis of medicine and I have the feeling these medicine do not really help. My mom is taking care of my granny everyday but my mom still works as well, during the day. As I live one hour away I cannot visit them that often, as I work too. 

The doctor says there are a lot of medicine still available, but the last time i went to the doctor she doubled the medicine dosis. One of my colleagues told me her granny is taking such heavy medicine that she is not even able to think or talk clear when taking these medicine, is this normal when taking huge dosis of medicine?

Just to give you an indication, my grandmom is currently on:
Levodopa/carbidopa 100/25mg 2 pills every 3 hours starting 6 AM up till 6 PM. (So 10 pills in total) and levodopa/carbidopa retardeva 200/50mg at 9 PM. 

Could you guys tell me if this dosis is strong? I noticed these medicine stop working after like 2,5 hours and my granny needs to wait half an hour to take new medicine. I am going to the doctor again in 2 weeks and I will tell the doctor she feels terrible, but I am so afraid she will up the medicine and my grandma will become even weaker. Its so painful to see her suffer this much, I wish I could do something..

Possible treatment option:

I   researched for how the investigational drugs for PSP are working  to   see if I could find anything readily available. I found the    investigational drugs that inhibit O-GlcNAcase enzyme lead to a   reduction in tau. Tau buildup is a main contributor to PSP and   Alzheimers, with the  exception of amyloid plaque buildup being another   in Alzheimers. What the information below shows is that a high fat, low   carb diet, Metformin, and quercetin inhibit the O-GlcNAcase enzyme  thus  theoretically reducing tau.

**Quercetin**

***Quercetin decreased the expression of global O-GlcNAcylation***   Our findings demonstrate that quercetin exhibited its anticancer effect  by ***decreasing the O-GlcNAcylation*** of AMPK. Further studies are needed to  explore how quercetin regulates O-GlcNAcylation in cancer.

[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330136619\_Quercetin\_induces\_cell\_death\_in\_cervical\_cancer\_by\_reducing\_O-GlcNAcylation\_of\_adenosine\_monophosphate-activated\_protein\_kinase](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330136619_Quercetin_induces_cell_death_in_cervical_cancer_by_reducing_O-GlcNAcylation_of_adenosine_monophosphate-activated_protein_kinase)

Quercetin   and quercetin-3-O-glucuronide suppressed ER stress with  decreased   phosphorylation of IRE1α and PERK, thereby inhibited TXNIP and  NLRP3   inflammasome activation, ultimately attenuated tau  phosphorylation in   okadaic acid (OA) induced SH-SY5Y cells. However, the  effect on tau   phosphorylation was blocked by downregulation of AMPKα1/2  with SiRNA   transfection. ***Moreover,   administration of quercetin enhanced  AMPK activity, inhibited IRE1α   and PERK phosphorylation, NLRP3  expression and tau phosphorylation and   improved cognitive disorder in  mice exposed to high fat diets.***   AMPK may be a key player that links ER  stress and tau phosphorylation   and mediates quercetin's effect on  cognitive disorder. Thus,  quercetin  and its AMPK activity may provide a  potential therapeutic  strategy for  treatment of AD patients.

[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/295684960\_Quercetin\_attenuates\_tau\_hyperphosphorylation\_and\_improves\_cognitive\_disorder\_via\_suppression\_of\_ER\_stress\_in\_a\_manner\_dependent\_on\_AMPK\_pathway](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/295684960_Quercetin_attenuates_tau_hyperphosphorylation_and_improves_cognitive_disorder_via_suppression_of_ER_stress_in_a_manner_dependent_on_AMPK_pathway)

**Metformin**

Although **cancer cells need more glucose** than normal cells to maintain  energy demand, chronic hyperglycemia induces metabolic alteration that  may **dysregulate signaling pathways, including the O-GlcNAcylation**   and  HIF1A (Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha) pathways. Metformin was    demonstrated to evoke metabolic stress and induce cancer cell death.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4016871/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4016871/)

**High Fat Diet**

The obtained results suggest that **dysregulation of O-GlcNAcylation**,   and  the related HIF1A pathway, via hyperglycemia, is responsible for   the  decreased cytotoxic efficiency of metformin in human ovarian  cancer   cells.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6163973/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6163973/)

**Investigational Drugs that inhibit O-GlcNAcaseand reduce build up of tau lead to PRP**

**ASN120290**

ASN120290’s therapeutic potential was been demonstrated in pre-clinical  studies. The drug, which is a selective ***inhibitor of the O-GlcNAcase***  enzyme, caused a ***significant reduction in the build-up of toxic  aggregations of tau protein*** into neurofibrillary tangles in the brain.

**MK-8719**

MK-8719 is an orally available potent and selective small-molecule ***OGA  inhibitor*** planned for evaluation for the treatment of PSP.    ***these diseases are associated with the formation and progressive spread  of toxic oligomers of tau protein in the brain.*** Preclinical data that  has been independently confirmed by several groups provides evidence  that OGA inhibition **reduces tau** pathology

**Thiamet G**

I am 23 and my mother (68) has had Parkinson's officially for the last 3 years now, we live together with nobody else. Over the time she has lost much of her mobility and is progressing at a quick rate in my eyes. She is losing a lot of weight and her ability to complete normal tasks in her life has dropped drastically. While she is still walking, she has begun to need a walking stick to help her get around. Her balance is poor and she has fallen twice, luckily they were not serious. She also walks with a hunch and a shuffle of her feet. Facial expressions have become non-existent and her speech is very slurred and difficult to hear.

I understand that keeping her independence is important and I do my best to accommodate this, by letting her do her own tasks in her own time and helping when she wants me to I try not to force help upon her. She is an independent woman and I think the slow loss of this independence is very difficult for her to accept

I have tried to speak to her about the progression and find out more about her specific condition but she doesn't open up during conversation and changes the subject without providing answers, I have offered to join her at the appointments with the neurologist but she isn't happy for me to come along.

I find it very worrying that she won't fill me in. The times that she has fallen she refused to call me and ask for help and lay on the ground for 20 minutes before she could get up. This attitude she has taken is making me feel like our roles have been reversed and I am the carer in this situation. 

Her siblings are completely useless and barely acknowledge that she is no longer able to do what she used to and seem to be happy to allow me to deal with these issues on my own. 

I don't know where to begin with questions but I would appreciate any opinions/ideas around this topic. It is her attitude toward her Parkinson's that is causing me to struggle to not get angry and frustrated around her, I don't enjoy being around her anymore and I feel like my job as a carer will negatively impact my own life until she dies and these thoughts are troubling.

Parkinson's is destroying the relationship between me and my mother and I don't know how I can act on this to help her help herself and change things for the better.

Any and all thoughts would be appreciated.",2019-06-26 06:56:39

&#x200B;

I had a DAT scan in February that came back abnormal. I've been having more symptoms like hallucinations, insomnia, stiff muscles, pain, depression/anxiety, fatigue than tremors or pill rolling.

&#x200B;

I finally went into the doctor today and she hadn't seen my DAT scan results and when I mentioned them she was like, ""You had a DAT scan? I wasn't sent that."" I started crying. Some of the tests she had me do were painful and frustrating. She was very dismissive of my symptoms and said she wanted me tested for Wilson's and vitamin B and D deficiency. I got upset at the end that I spent a couple grand for the DAT scan and it hadn't even been sent to her and she was like, ""Oh you spent that out of pocket?"" and suddenly she found it. It wasn't the actual brain image, just a report saying that to the eye that it looked normal, but according to some computer diagnostics it was two deviations abnormal.

&#x200B;

After that she was willing to prescribe me levodopa, but said my hallucinations that I described sounded more in line with Lewy Body Dementia, but quickly added that she doesn't believe I have that, either. 

&#x200B;

I am much less scared of the possibility of having Parkinson's than Lewy Body Dementia and looked up the Wilson's disease and saw that it can cause cirrhosis and I've known two people to die from that and is a huge fear for me. I very rarely drink alcohol I am so terrified of cirrhosis. I want to get a second opinion, but my husband is being dismissive saying it's all in my head and I should just listen to the doctor because they are an expert.",2019-06-25 03:29:20

I am getting over 6 hours (720 minutes) intense exercise in the week, but should be higher (swimming/boxing)

&#x200B;

PART I - Safety in hot weather. Not just us exercising, but heat & high humidity can be deadly:

 

Early mornings, before sunrise, is best  time for summer for those of us in the South. We tend to think ""only  85F"" but at 85% humidity your body can not cool itself by perspiration.  So it's a heat index of 110F.

[https://www.weather.gov/safety/heat-index](https://www.weather.gov/safety/heat-index)

88F with 85% Humidity puts you at 110F Heat Index.

Hydrate, take it easy, pace yourself.

Heat exhaustion or heat stroke?

[https://www.weather.gov/safety/heat-illness](https://www.weather.gov/safety/heat-illness)

I've   been running 5K's for a while. Not the fastest, but still running. So I   have a better idea of what I am doing and how strenuous it is. My 3.1   mile loop has about 100 foot elevation climb, so on hot afternoons I   just do a 2 miles loop, slow down, and when I am home jump into a cold   shower to bring temp back down. Keeping safe.

Biggest  one I need to remember is to keep hydrated (pee  pale yellow) and add enough  electrolytes to keep body chemistry  balanced. Oranges are natural at  electrolytes, so helps to eat an  orange or two. (potassium and sugars).

WHO (World Health Organization's) Rehydration formula:

>A  basic oral rehydration therapy solution can also be prepared when   packets of oral rehydration salts are not available. It can be made   using 6 level teaspoons (25.2 grams) of sugar and 0.5 teaspoon (2.9   grams) of salt in 1 litre of water.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_rehydration_therapy#cite_note-who.int-16)[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_rehydration_therapy#cite_note-wikihow_ors-17) The [molar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_concentration) [ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio) of sugar to salt should be 1:1 and the solution should not be [hyperosmolar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molarity).[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_rehydration_therapy#cite_note-18) The Rehydration Project states, ""Making the mixture a little diluted (with more than 1 litre of clean water) is not harmful.""[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_rehydration_therapy#cite_note-19)

source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral\_rehydration\_therapy#Preparation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_rehydration_therapy#Preparation)

Notes about the Home made sports drink: 1/4 cup sugar is 50 grams; 1/4 tsp salt is 1.4 grams.

I've added notes to previous post, dropping amount of sugar and increasing salt per 1 liter.

&#x200B;

Per you pounds of body weight; drink about 1/2 oz to 1 oz per pound!

I  weight in at 230 pounds. I should be drinking  at least one gallon (128 oz) to  two (256 oz) gallons of water a day! 

I  use a 16 oz tumbler and typically drink at least eight of those a day  (128 oz) but running, cycling, swimming in summer and I really need  twice that. Running  or back packing midday, you may need more!

You  should be peeing almost clear. Clear means ""You have enough fluids, but too much water may mean flushing those electrolytes your body needs. Light yellow is good to keep  hydrated. 

If you drink Gatorade,  two to three bottles of water, one  Gatorade will keep your electrolytes in balance. Only water means you  are lacking sodium and potassium for correct electrical (brain, heart,  muscle) signals.

I've ended up in ER -  lack of potassium. Cardiologist told me to skip Gatorade (too much  sugar, even G2) and eat a 1oz bag of potato chips for electrolytes.

At  60 years old my goal is to try to remain active as long as possible,  and stay away from Emergency Rooms. If you spot a friend with Heat  Stroke - get them to the Emergency Room ASAP. Hours away on a back  packing trip have ""rehydration packets""  and mix with water and get them  drinking asap.

PART III (From Joy at Skratch Labs):

&#x200B;

 [joyatskratch](https://www.reddit.com/user/joyatskratch/)1 point · [6 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/a65ogf/if_salt_dehydrates_you_then_why_does_hydrating/ec0059p/)

**Water  can also move into the body through channels known as SGLT1  transporters that actively transport sodium and glucose across the small  intestine. These channels use energy to move 2 sodium ions and one  glucose molecule into the body. As this happens, 210 molecules of water  also move across, effectively getting a free ride into the body as  sodium and glucose pay a toll to gain entry.** While this seems  like a lot of water relative to sodium and glucose, this gateway is rate  limited or locked by the availability of sodium and glucose. Crunching  the numbers, to move 1 liter of water across the gut through this  mechanism, just over 12 grams of sodium and close to 48 grams of glucose  (a 4.8% glucose concentration) would be needed.  This is one reason why  [oral rehydration solutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_rehydration_therapy)  used to treat diarrheal diseases contain grams, not milligrams of  sodium in them along with some sugar or glucose to help take advantage  of this route (as a side note, our Wellness[ Hydration Mix](http://www.skratchlabs.com/collections/drinks/products/rescue-hydration-mix?variant=834799545) meets those oral rehydration solution standards).

Because our [Sport Hydration Drink Mix](http://bit.ly/sporthydrationdrinkmix)  contains significantly more sodium (310 mg per ½ liter or 16.9 ounces)  than other sports drinks to help replace the sodium we lose in our sweat  as well as plenty of glucose, a relatively greater, albeit still very  small, amount of water (25 ml) can be theoretically co-transported  through the active transport of sodium and glucose. In theory, the  active transport of sodium itself along with other molecules like  glucose also creates a more favorable concentration difference for the  flow of water into the body by osmosis. That all said, starting with a  sports drink with a concentration that is too high and without enough  sodium or salt makes this a real uphill battle despite active transport  systems that might help to facilitate water transport. This  significantly increases the risk of stomach problems especially over the  course of a really long day since water flow is still primarily  dependent on osmosis.  Hope that helps! Let me know if you have  additional questions or want some links to scientific studies/journals  :)

&#x200B;

Hopefully if Joy is still active on reddit, she will respond and correct any mistakes.

If anyone has additional input, please let me know. I've been reading up on this as friends are active with hiking in summer months.  We have a Parkinson's Hiking Team!  I have joked we need to carry 20 kg of gear and cover 8 miles in two hours. No takers (hilly terrain I can cover six miles with that pack, need to keep working at it). Maybe I should carry 19kg of Skratch and 1kg of Sinemet.

*POPPING FOR PARKINSON'S is a project created by Simone Sistarelli. It consists in Popping*  
*technique dance classes for people with Parkinson's.*

*After an extensive research on Parkinson's, dance therapy, music therapy and teaching techniques, Simone developed a Popping class made specifically for people with Parkinson's.*  
*The first official Popping for Parkinson's class was back in July 2015 in Wimbledon with the South London Younger Parkinson's Network. Thanks to SLYPN, Simone's dream became reality. Since then, he taught classes all over the world.*  
*In 2018, Simone opened the official Italian chapter of Popping For Parkinson's. Popping For*  
*Parkinson's is now is an international project, offering free regular Popping classes to people with Parkinson's in the UK and Italy.*  
*Popping For Parkinson's is now officially in the Universal Hip Hop Museum Hall Of Fame, the most prestigious award in the Hip Hop culture.*  
*Simone's aim was to do something positive for the community and inspire them as much as Hip*  
*Hop inspired him in the first place.*  
*Since there is still no cure for Parkinson's, a key point of this project is making students feel more comfortable with themselves, ultimately aiming at a better quality of life.*

This all started about 2 weeks ago when I started getting tremors in both my hands. I noticed a slight tremor in my ring finger and maybe pinky before this but all of a sudden it was both hands. I game a lot. I play guitar, piano  and a few other instruments. I have osteoarthritis pretty bad in my hands and I thought maybe it was just my arthritis. Now I'm not so sure. I can feel the tremor in my head and neck, not nearly as bad as in my hands but it's like waves washing up on shore, always there and always going. Since researching PD and reading stories of people who have been diagnosed I have come to realise that I have more symptoms than just my hands. It is hard to type on my phone. I have very poor posture, a hunch and rounded shoulders. My forearms feel heavy and weak and are sore which is from the shaking of my hands. I remember the couple days leading up to it I was not eating because I had no money, I was living off of 711 and coffee. I'm hanging on to the thought that this is just stress, over worked hand and arms muscles coupled with poor diet and poor restless sleep. Honestly though I am not very hopeful. The blood tests we had done all came back normal except for my neutropenia which is something I've lived with for years, a bit too much creatine, and my ECG said I was beating slower than 60 bpm. My memory is foggy and my balance is off a bit. The next step is to get my head scanned, and I'm pretty sure they're going to find something. I have had many CT scans on the rest of my body but never my head.

Is there anything I can do? Somebody in another thread suggested a drugged up smoothie with something in it to jump start your nervous system and see if that's what it really is. I've started running, quit smoking, quit eating food that is high in sugar and generally am just eating healthier. I am vaping and smoking a very small amount of weed but those are the only two substances I'm taking, except for my meds. I'm on and been on buproprion and trazadone for a couple years now. Honestly I've been depressed for almost as long as I can remember.

I live in Canada which is the world leader in PD research so I am hopeful even if this is something I have there is a way to treat it or maybe at best stop the progression? Science is basically what has me keeping sane.",2019-06-18 06:44:04

I have an aide come twice a day for two hours in the morning and two hours in the evening, and she goes to daycare when I am at work if she is willing to go.  I sometimes get an additional aide so that I can spend more time with my wife.  I am responsible for her care the rest of the time day and night.  My mom is very opposed to being put in any type of assisted living facility, and I am willing to take care of her, so an ALF is not currently an option.

&#x200B;

To have more free time, I was thinking about trying to find someone close to me in a similar situation.  For a couple or few hours a day about twice  a week I could care for someone with dementia in addition to my mom at the same time.  The other caregiver could do the same by watching my mom in addition to his/her family member with dementia.   Without any money being exchanged, each caregiver would have more free time.

&#x200B;

Has anyone tried this or something similar?  If so, how did it go?  There are several support groups near me, but I have never gone to one of these.  I was thinking about going to one and mentioning the idea.

I’ve moved around a bit for the last 2 years and haven’t really had a stable relationship with a doctor which I know is important. I just recently got health insurance back again and have a new appointment with a new PCP. I’ve tried so many different medicines, none seem to really help with my symptoms and end up just making me sicker. I find it hard to do anything with amount of discomfort and pain I feel on a daily basis. I am not on any kind of medication. The only thing that seems to help is smoking marijuana. 

The last job I had became to difficult for me I ended up quitting after being there for 5 years. 
It was a standing all day supervisor position.
I don’t drive due to the cramping in my ankles from the dystonia. Its very frightening to me, I rather not drive knowing there is a risk that I may lose control. 

Being young that I am (28F) diagnosed genetically i feel like I can’t do anything or need to rely on someone else. Everyday is different and difficult.

&#x200B;

Context: He's a stubborn man who put off going to the doctor for the longest time. After some convincing from the family he finally went and the PD was confirmed. This happened last month and as stated, I don't live with or near him and we actually barely talk as it. Not that there's bad blood, we just both live our own lives and really only check-in every few months and visit for the holidays. He's also very direct, for a time we all thought he had Asperger's but not sure if that was ever proven. Regardless, he was always good to me and my sister, and i always felt a strong connection to him even though we don't talk often. He's in his late 50's now and I'm 30m.

&#x200B;

Now he has this disease and while I know it's not technically lethal, it obviously carries a lot of hardship, some of which I can suspect to be worse than death, as I've heard this disease breaks you down from the inside out. I've been reading some of the past posts on this thread and the possible outcomes seem bleak at best. 

&#x200B;

But with that being said, I am inclined to remain positive and be there for him best I can, from a distance. For his birthday I sent him a neck massage machine, he said he liked it alot and that it helps. For Father's day I am sending him a heavy brass pen, the kind that's easy to grip. I hope he likes it!

&#x200B;

Anyway, I know there's more to be done than buying gifts for someone with PD. If there's anything you feel I can do on my end, to help in anyway, I want to learn and do more for my dad. I plan to visit him in a couple weeks, I'll only have time to be with him for a day or so, but I want to make it worthwhile.

&#x200B;

It's my assumption that people with recently diagnosed PD don't want to be asked 1000 questions about what they're going through, but I could be wrong. If anyone has any experience, of how to best tread these first few months, I'm open to any and all ideas to be helpful and not a burden to my father.",2019-06-14 03:58:57

Usual start, roll over. Feet on floor, take my morning medications.

Slowly stand up and start take one step at a time to get to the back door and let the dogs run into the backyard.

Noticed the kitchen clock. 4:30 AM. Way too early for be getting up. Let Dogs back inside and back in bed to hopefully sleep a while. 5:40 AM sleep was elusive, time to get up and get moving.

7:15 AM pretty day, need to get moving.

Jogging clothes on, out the door. My running partner knows the routine. Off we go.

Haven't run since Sunday. Normally would have run Tuesday but had my every four months dental cleaning that morning, conference call yesterday, so Four days need to get moving. Oh, hard time with flossing. I try to floss and water pick, but tremors make it difficult. Periodontal disease is no joke so I make it for cleaning every three to four months. Insurance pays for every six, but if your gums bleed while flossing it means bacteria/tartar build up so going in more often helps keep that at bay.

Made it out for the run. Felt good, different jog path but 3.4 miles, so I got in my 5K (3.1 miles) plus a few extra steps.

As I am heading back up the hill to the house I am aware I am leaning over much more than usual. Crud. Head looking at ground, shoulders forward, felt like I was ready to fall over. NOOOOOOO! Forced myself to go back up right, head over shoulder, shoulders over hips, hips over feet. Posture. It took all my effort to keep going and not fall over.

Made it back to house. Normally I stop my timer and walk and stretch at this point.

Nope couldn't transition from run to walk mode. Started going into festination (my feet do a happy dance, but I am not in control they are just moving up and down). Took more than a few minutes to reset. I kept debating ""fall on the lawn, but no luck in anything I wanted to do"".

**Sarah Kings's 5's tip came to mind:**

**1. Stop Moving**

**2. Stand Tall (shift weight back to heels)**

**3. Shake it off (relax)**

**4. Shift your weight (rock side to side)**

**5. Step forward.**

&#x200B;

Noticed the time 8:45. three hours after I took meds. I normally take meds, wait 20 to 30, go running. Even for a sprint triathlon (two hours) taking meds right before hitting the water helps. My timing was way off this morning.  

Starting to think time to bump up my DBS settings. Damn it, I have been trying to keep on lower total dose of Sinemet and lowest voltage settings to stretch out battery life. Just suspect it is time to bump up as I haven't had festination issues in the past three years (since DBS in 2016).",2019-06-14 00:14:30

Would you do it for initial diagnosis? Second (third, fourth) opinions? Follow ups only? What would you like or not like about it? Would you pay for it or only use it if insurance covered it (and what would you pay for, say, a 30min video chat?)

Besides the fact that the tablets are measured to “perfection”. I have been considering this a lot, just having my dad stay on the form of ldopa he’s on an having a sprinkle of the velvet bean powder for both of our smoothies, or try it on myself first.
Excuse my desperation, but I have really been experiencing some depressive episodes ever since my dad had a drastic decline in a year...",2019-06-06 15:10:57

What were your experiences with l/c when you started? Did it get better? Do you still experience side effects?

The last time she was over was about 6 months ago. She had problem putting her makeup on. She had to hold her right hand with her left to steady it.

This time she was trying to setup her travel mirror but kept knocking it over before giving up and telling my mom she needs to buy one for the house. At dinner last night she did ok serving herself. She put the salad tongs back in the bowl and at the last second before letting go of them she had a bit of a twitch kick in and some of it flew out the side of the bowl.

She has been an extremely active person in her life thus it's been hard for her adjusting to her diagnosis even now. 
However, up until a year ago she was regular with her physiotherapy and could manage many tasks by her self. Around 2 years ago her sodium levels dropped a lot and she suffered confusion, hallucinations and would talk, fight etc in her sleep. However, when her sodium levels were brought back up those symptoms vanished.

Anyway, lately since a couple of weeks, her health has rapidly deteriorated and she started having those symptoms again where she is extremely confused (not making sense, talking to people that arent there, refusing to ask for help and not getting enough sleep due to the extreme body tremors and movement). We got her admitted and they brought her sodium levels up, however, the symptoms have not gone away. The hospital discharged her and sent her back. Her condition got worse in the 3 days. She complained she wasnt able to breathe properly. So we took her to the hospital again one day ago. They have put her in icu and found that her oxygen levels were low and she has a chest infection which has somehow only gotten worse since yesterday.

We are not getting proper replies from doctors etc as to why this is happening. Has someone experienced something similar with this? Because we are not sure if she is mentally weak now and not getting better or she will eventually get better again like last time? 

Is it possible for parkinsons to deteriorate so quickly or is it the other problems at play here? Any answers would be appreciated. Thank you.",2019-06-01 21:26:22

My relative was diagnosed at stage 3 just under two years ago. Before that it was thought that she was dealing with anxiety and/or depression. Not functioning well for periods, didn't want to do anything, gave up her license willingly, sleep issues. She's already at stage 4. It's not so much the movement issues, it is that it seems that the brain issues seem so much worse. The  meds really don't help much. When they are administered, she's already very much in a down time. Almost catatonic, staring, drooling at times, does not respond to people around her. After the meds kicks in, she may be more cognizant, but sometimes not for long. She also tends to become very energized and almost manic. She also has Parkinson's dementia (Or maybe LBD -- this is just a suspicion though.) So, there's a lot of memory issues and issues even understanding people or concepts that a young child would understand. There are still periods where she seems not fully there, but seems to follow conversations going on around her, and smiling in response to questions.

I'm a 21-year-old male from Texas. I've come here to ask for advice from y'all since I've read a lot of the posts in this sub and it seems that many of you have similar experiences. About a month ago my Mom (56 years old) was diagnosed with PD. I received the news of this while away at College. I was really shocked when I heard, but when I talked with her on the phone she seemed to be mostly alright emotionally. She mostly talked about how she was going to exercise more and focus on a better diet (she is already really active and eats well).

&#x200B;

I came home for the summer a few days ago and she seemed more upset about it. She came home from work today and was crying because she read that 80% of Parkinson's patients end up with some form of Dementia. I consoled her and she seemed to feel better, but it really hurts me to see her like this. She has an appointment with a good Neurologist in Houston in July who will talk to her about starting treatment, and she's going on a trip to Europe with my dad before that, which I hope might make her feel a little better. She sees a physical therapist and some kind of ""wellness"" person (I tolerate my Mom's homeopathic tendencies if she thinks it helps her and she seeks real treatment as well). I think it might be good for her to see a counselor who can help people emotionally process difficult diagnoses and life changing events like this.

&#x200B;

I want to do everything I can to help my Mom. I'm in a bit of a unique position, since my dad is quite a bit older than me (71) and my sister goes to school in Europe. Her symptoms right now are pretty mild as far as PD symptoms go. For right now she just has some mobility/strength issues in her right shoulder and hip. I really hope that her symptoms progress slowly. She has worked hard and faced a lot of difficulty in her life. All I want for her is to be able to find peace and be happy. I have an internship out of town this summer, but I plan to be home every weekend to go to the gym with her. 

&#x200B;

Sorry if all this is a little wild and unorganized. It's late at night and all the realizations are hitting me hard right now. 

&#x200B;

Do y'all have any advice for someone like me? Do you think looking for a counselor is a good idea? Do you think July is a little late for the Neurologist appointment (apparently it was difficult to get an earlier appointment)?  I hear medicine only treats the symptoms, and that it won't slow the progression of the disease. Any ideas on how I can help her stay positive despite her condition?

The past month+ I’ve been having daily pain. I’ve had this at a lesser extent since my late teens (used to foam roll quite a lot thinking it was from exercise exertion), and before would have it about 10 days total in a month. Now it’s constant regardless of on-off periods, though it tends to peak at night. 

This burning pain affects my whole right side (currently burning from toes, up the leg, along the right side of spine, down the arm to the fingers; sometimes, it even burns along the right side of my face and neck, and in the left calf and hand). I’d estimate that it’s accompanied with weakness, stiffness, and some sadness (and lots of whining) about 80% of the time. It’ll give the false impression of paralyzation, the thought/feeling that I can’t move my arm or toes. Also reduces my appetite and causes nausea, especially towards anything sweet. I’ve been exercising daily- squats, push-ups, lots of dancing, stretching- but it’s not muscle soreness. It’s its own distinct pain. 

Doing push-ups offers relief for 5 minutes. Ginger juice seems to help? Heat seems to exacerbate it, and while some coolness helps, real cold stuff def doesn’t. Stress and sadness (not apathy) will trigger or worsen it. u/ParkieDude had previously wrote about the magic of massage, but in my case it mostly seems to worsen it. Maybe it’s a special type of massage?

I’m currently on Pramipexole (Miraprex/Sifrol) 1.25 mg/day total, with a .375 slow release form in the morning. This was recently upped 2 weeks ago from 1 mg and it has combatted apathy, low motivation, and tremor quite splendidly. I read that dopamine agonists, particularly Pramipexole, are shown to reduce pain so a bit flummoxed. 

Actually, what do I call this pain? Central pain? Neuropathic pain? Nociceptive? Has anyone had a similar pain be relieved by antidepressants?",2019-05-21 13:11:58

With no changes, I lost 10 pounds in the 1st 2 weeks,  and some more this week. I've had vitamin screens, and I was only D deficient. There must be something I needed to metabolize sugar and stop fat creation.

He has been on the same dose of carbidopa-levodopa for 6 years (three 10/100 Sinemet a day). He also takes Azilect/rasagaline which once increased once.

The past few years and especially recent months he requires assistance dressing, using the bathroom and getting up. He has to have my mother move his feet out to get up from a seated position.

I'm concerned as it is getting too much for my mother and he is not having much fun either. They live in a city where few would want to live voluntarily so I'm worried his neurologist isn't the best. He is 77.

Q: Is it unusual that he is on such a low dose, never increased, and has such difficulty with movement??

Thanks for any insights, I tried to get him to go to a movement clinic in a nearby town for a second opinion but he didn't want to.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Do neurologists tend to prescribe low doses wary of being blamed down the road for carbidopa/levodopa side effects?

EDIT 2: My dad went to his local neurologist appointment and my mom reports he was given the diagnosis of MSA (Multiple Systems Atrophy). Apparently his Cdopa/Ldopa initial dosage can't be raised because it could lower his blood pressure further. Heartbreaking to hear that a really awful disease is actually something even worse. Unfair to my parents who have had difficult hands dealt to them already. I know life is unfair but.. I guess I don't want it to be unfair to them.
I'm still encouraging him to see the University of Wisconsin movement disorders clinic. Apparently a lot of people with MSA are initially diagnosed with PD. The symptoms he is experiencing (low blood pressure, urinary difficulties, etc) do seem to meet this diagnosis.",2019-05-17 10:03:56

Then some mild shaking. Now I've got a rather noticeable tremor, both while my hand is resting and active. I was vigilantly ignoring it until a few weeks ago, when I nearly dropped a stock of a pretty potent carcinogen while working in the lab.

Went to my doctor thinking pinched nerve, but he told me that usually presents in a few specific fingers, not the whole hand. He said it could be young onset Parkinson's, referred me to a neurologist that specializes in PD, and now I have to wait until late August for an appointment. My doctor's inability to hide his emotions didn't help- an appointment that started jovial ended pretty somber. 

My grandfather had Parkinson's. I noted a few weeks ago that I felt off balance going down stairs, but not up them. Didn't think anything of it at the time, but it hasn't gone away. A friend (unaware of the full situation) commented yesterday that I ""walk like an old person"" because my right foot was shuffling a bit. That really unsettled me. And now my left hand is tingling.

Anyways, I'm 21 and terrified. The tremor is massively interfering with my research job - which I love. I'm just trying to make it through the summer without getting fired or destroying anything. My boss has been understanding so far, but I'm not sure how long that will hold out.

I've been staying with him for the last month and I've noticed some things that he could really use some help with.

He takes carbidopa/levidopa for his rigidity/movement, but lately, often at night, he will start having hallucinations or confusion where he starts talking very quietly/whispering but still thinks people across the house can hear him whispering, and I can tell he's really frustrated and confused by the type of hallucinations he's having. He starts thinking he hears things outside the house and he wanders around the house for many hours at a time in the middle of the night, confused and probably freaked out. 

He frequently complains that his head is burning up or his brain is burning up while this is happening. He says ""I need you to help me figure out why my brain is on fire.""  

He's been to so many doctors appointments for his symptoms, and half the time is convinced this issue has nothing to do with his PD, but I think it's to do with his carbidopa/levidopa and that he's gradually had to take more of it daily to get rid of his rigidity and movement issues.

I really want to help him get rid of this issue, as it's been happening more and more lately. He used to be the type of person to work all day every day, and I can tell this is really bugging him lately, but he's not the best at communicating these things. 

Is there anything we can do to reduce the hallucination and confusion side effects? This is happening a couple times a week now. He can range from nearly zero PD symptoms during the day to barely able to walk with intense confusion and hallucinations at night. Is it likely the cause of his carbidopa/levidopa building up in his system?

Are any of you familiar with this feeling of ""brain burn"" that he keeps bringing up? I can't find anything online about this feeling he keeps bringing up.

There is a sizeable volume of peer reviewed research that suggests that gut-microbiome-brain axis is key in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Often, symptoms of constipation/microbiome dysregulation happen early in the disease, years before the motor symptoms manifest, apparently mediated by TLR2 and TLR4 (toll like receptors), after which alpha synuclein generated in the gut appears to ascend to the brain. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/oaetutdm2xx21.png?width=928&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd10db432e90a2c329fd9ec32175c78460c9c03f

As the disease progresses, this communication becomes bi-directional with synuclein descending to the gut as well. Vagal nerve degeneration is seen in most Parkinson's patients under histology as well, and patients who've had a vagotomy in which the vagal nerve is intentionally cut have a significantly lower risk of developing PD. There is some interesting data about vagal nerve stimulation having potential as therapy and in delaying disease progression.

&#x200B;

Here is a diagram of the vagal nerve (it is usually stimulated from behind the left ear):

https://preview.redd.it/ny3xhawf1xx21.png?width=773&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c816f69e0156f0b6dd6da3695a5379af2fa36eb

I have been considering getting a vagal nerve stimulator for my mother who has PD (GammaCore is the only one I am aware of) for home usage.

[Pic of the device from the company's website](https://preview.redd.it/fz4gzy260xx21.png?width=333&format=png&auto=webp&s=c32a41eec9755e83797165d4f1838f6c48f14937)

&#x200B;

She tried it in the clinic where she gets her TENS, I'm not sure if it had much effect. Her psychiatrist made the interesting observation that vagal nerve stimulation seems to only work at the clinic, not from home (even with the same machine parameters). This makes me wonder if it's placebo, or if most people don't know how to accurately do the therapy at home (possibly because it's harder to place on yourself than on another person). Another interesting point is that it can only be done from the left side because the right side has a small connection to the heart and can cause heart beat irregularities.

So the weekend previously I ran the Foxtrot 5K. I set my fastest time of 37 minute 13 minutes! Huge for me as that was good pace, and no stitches in my chin this time.

Last weekend was a Sprint Triathlon. This was a short event with 300 meter swim, 20K bike, 2 mile run.

I figured 300 Meter swim was doable. Oh, I just started taking swimming lessons two months ago. I may not be the smartest person, but I had two goals for this event. Don't drown and Finish.  First turn was easy as I was in the midst of a bunch of people. Admitted all passing me, but like a fish I just followed the school. First time in open water, so panic sets in as you can not see much. I made a mistake of clear goggles, fine for pool swims, but a disaster for early morning into a sunrise. Second turn was simple, but I mistook an orange triangle for a red course marker. I kept going straight. It was relaxing but soon realized I was the only one around. Uh oh. By them the jet ski with a sled showed up as I had gone too far off course!

So back to shore. My Garmin recorded 450M swim. Ya, I was in the water for 28 minutes. I figured with a 300 M swim there was no need to wear a wet suit, as the water wasn't that cold. My muscles were pretty cramped by the time I got back to shore.

Thankfully the bike is where I am most comfortable. Felt good. I was the only rider on a Catrike. Three wheels as when I am doing full excursion I am shaking like crazy and can not maintain steering, so I was allowed to compete on a three wheel trike.

By the time I got to the run. It was my slowest every. My legs felt like concrete. I was fighting dystonia and just exhausted. I didn't stop, but kept pressing on.

So 2.5 hours later, I was one of the last to cross the finish line. Rested for a while, more Sinemet, finally able to drive home. Once home took a rare nap for two hours. My wife thinks I am overdoing it, but we must never give up and keep moving!",2019-05-09 23:50:09

It all started with a muscle twitch in my right quad. I recently injured my right ankle (grade 1 sprain) and was driving for the first time in a week after being non-weight bearing. On the way home, a portion of my quad started twitching very rapidly, no pain, and continued until I would extend my leg. That stopped eventually, but the next day, I started to experience muscle twitches all over my body, literally anywhere you could think of. I also experienced weird dreams in the following days, continuation of twitches, and now a new and concerning symptom. I had pain in the left side of my neck for a while which I chalked up to TMJ, but that went away. Now, the back of my neck feels “weird” and moves my head very slightly and jolts it in whichever direction, causing me to wince and is extremely uncomfortable. They are very light tremors but they are nonstop, all day, 24/7 for the past few days. I have an appointment with my PCP in a week, I was just hoping someone could shed some light on what they think it might be. Thank you.",2019-05-08 03:51:30

40, Male, ~190 lbs (86 kg), 6' tall (182 cm)

About two weeks ago my brother saw a highly rated neurologist at the recommendation of a friend due to muscle tightness on the right side of his body (Spastic Hemiplegia).

He told the Neurologist about years of chronic ankle pain/tightness, recently developed hand, shoulder and neck tightness running up into his face. Our mother feels he's been depressive for the past decade, but I feel he's been that way since childhood. He has been sleeping poorly for years, but this could also be the fact that marriage often does that (certainly ruined my sleep) coupled with the high stress executive level work he does. He does not have a loss of smell, balance problems or true tremors.

The Neurologist did the walking test, etc. and very quickly gave him a PD diagnosis.

He took the Levodopa Challenge and saw no result and his brain MRI came back clean.

Given the two negative results I was encouraged and began to work the problem from my perspective - given my previous experience in PT modalities.

I spoke to him at length and worked his ankle problem first. To me, it sounded more like tendonitis than muscular contraction.

I asked him if his muscles feel more flexed or more stiff. He said definitely flexed and that he can relax them if he tries, but they're contracting otherwise. I'm not sure if he can be counted as a reliable narrator for this though.

Then I asked him about his face and it became clear it's his neck/shoulder (can't tell which) that's pulling on his face and not his face itself.

That's a huge difference. I then took a step back and determined that there was currently more evidence of a lack of PD than there was of PD. Well sort of, but whatever, all he could technically be diagnosed with is Spastic Hemiplegia.

When eliminating the ankle and face from the equation, we're left with muscles largely managed by the Brachial Plexus and therefore there's a reasonable shot at this simply being a spinal impingement/abrasion/swelling in the cervical spine.

I suggested he see a movement disorder specialist as well, but I don't think he's done so.

Following this he saw the Neurologist a second time, who unfortunately, stood by his diagnosis. I've no idea if he brought up my points about him potentially creating a referral / narrator bias towards PD as he hasn't gotten back to me since.

Next steps are a scheduled Spinal MRI as well as a DaTscan. 

Am I reaching here? I try to stay grounded in reality in medical situations, but I can't discuss directly with the doctor so maybe I'm just spinning my wheels.

If the DaTscan comes up clean it won't necessarily mean anything, but if the spinal MRI comes up clean then I guess we're in the realm of Parkinsonism. If that's the case, but isn't responding to PD meds, the reality is that no one knows and he's just exhibiting PD like symptoms right? If so, then the reality is simply he has XYZ symptoms, we watch them and treat them, but we don't actually know and therefore take it a day at a time and stay open to possibilities.

Is there anything wrong with my assessment or view of the future here? I get angry in these situations, I want to fight, but right now it seems like the family got knocked down and isn't getting back up. I'm concerned about providing false hope and about pushing too hard on people to fight.

I myself am cracking open every book, reading every journal I can get my hands on. I refuse to watch my family suffer helplessly. There's so many possibilities here and I think it's pointless to focus on the bad that could as opposed to accepting that we don't know the future and we shouldn't project our fears onto it. Again though, I don't want to be a toxic force of denial.

Edit: I have reason to believe the Neurologist might not have been the one who ordered the Spinal MRI. Brother mentioned last week that a friend recommended an excellent neurosurgeon who wanted a Spinal MRI. Time-wise, it's unlikely he saw that surgeon already. 

Perhaps he mentioned that to his Neurologist who then ordered the Spinal, perhaps he did get a quick appointment with the surgeon. I actually hope for the latter as it provides more evidence that the Neurologist could be arrogant and presumptive, but ya, I know, that's getting pretty deep down the rabbit hole.",2019-05-02 05:58:33

I have few questions about parkinson's symptoms and I didn't find clear answers online... hope you can help and thank you for reading.

I am asking for stage 1 symptoms, so when it is the beginning. Those are symptoms I am having so refer to me directly. 

In addition I would like to add that I feel unease because my dad was just diagnosed with Als and I am nervous on myself.   I am also checking with my neurologist of course (EMG test for Als was negative), i will make other tests soon.

&#x200B;

so, my questions:

on tremors - some months ago one finger on my left had started shaking more and more often intermittently. then it stopped. then the shaking moved to my right hand finger, and then to my right hand another finger. tremors were always while at rest. Now it's on my pinky left finger, sometime during the day. 

1)  if a finger is shaking, is it a constant 24h7d shaking or it can be very often for very long during the day, then stop for also a long period and start over?

2) when it starts with a finger, can it be that it moves to another finger, and the first one that showed signs stops shaking? or moves to another finger in another hand?

&#x200B;

on muscle stiffness\\cricks - I often had stiffness on the base of my right foot. recently with shaking coming to my left hand pinky, i noticed my right foot is stiff and it just doesn't go away. When i rest and when I  walk. I don't have problems walking at all. it is just the base of the foot annoying and the left leg feels a little dizzy. 

3) when we refer to stiffness or cricks in parkinson's , is it 24h7d or comes and go?

&#x200B;

I am aware all I have can be related to benign causes or because I'm psyching myself into it. But i am like this, get psyched out easily and would really appreciate your input while i do other analysis that can take time.

&#x200B;

4) what are other relevant signs i should look at in your opinion (is EMG a good test for parkinson)? And what exams make sense at the beginning? Internet is full of stuffs, but I wanted to ask to people that know by experience and can explain it better than a generic website... 

&#x200B;

Thank you again for reading. I hate illnesses that take times to diagnose. For my dad took 7 months to diagnose Als with several wrong diagnoses in the middle. 

My prayer are with all of you for a fast recovery and cure.

I haven't seen any other mentions about the Alexander Technique on this subreddit, and I figured I might as well make a post about it! My mother's name is [Candace Cox](http://www.bigsky-at.ca/what-at.html), and she is a researcher who has been working with many people living with PD for about a decade. She is what is called an Alexander Technique Teacher, which is basically a system of balance and movement-therapy to help general health and day-to-day well-being (I don't know if you have heard of the [Poise Project](https://www.thepoiseproject.org/alexander-technique-for-parkinsons), but she has been involved with a lot of their work). She was recently [interviewed by CBC news](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/parkinson-s-candace-cox-actor-edmonton-1.5083075?fbclid=IwAR2DYeg_UBqGTt8sZsHG3bjufUpYZN1nHrIkuPWR91CP8J3v71ulcQnPetM) regarding her work.

Candace (it's weird to refer to her by her first name, wow) was invited this year for the third time to [present her research at the World Parkinson's Conference in Kyoto, Japan](https://imgur.com/gallery/Deg6719) \--and part of that conference is a [book](https://mailchi.mp/4db7e9347759/alexandertechniqueforparkinsonscandacecox?fbclid=IwAR2dYBFPkauRqIavIQkGaEYolYfb2TrNRwlKgZl5NKzYsi_sRtlZ95JMz-c) she is working on as part of the basis for her research and as part of standardizing Alexander Technique teachers' work involving their students with Parkinson's Disease worldwide.

The project is currently in [its funding phase](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/alexander-technique-for-parkinson-s-disease-book/x/278673?create_edit=true#/), and all money that we (I am currently acting as the Art Director for the project) make towards the book that does not go directly towards printing is going into further developing her research. the intention for the book is, as mentioned above, as a basis for research, but also as an exercise and informative book for those living with Parkinson's and their partners to use as a reference when they either don't have access to an AT teacher, or are between lessons.  

Mostly we just want to raise awareness about the work she is doing, our book project, and about the Alexander Technique in general. But to be perfectly honest, she is the leading AT teacher in North America specifically when it comes to the progress and work she has made and done with those living with PD. I've grown up watching her work with some of these people, and their recovery of function is amazing.

I should mention that **this is not a cure for PD**--would that it was--but regular practice of some of the principles of Alexander Technique really makes a difference towards daily living.

If you all have any questions or concerns, I am reachable through my reddit account or at my email address: [lochlancox1@gmail.com](mailto:lochlancox1@gmail.com), and through the various sites that I have linked here! We are based just east of Toronto, Ontario, if anyone is interested in our geographic location. If you would like to see anything else, or have questions regarding that the links I have provided, don't hesitate to ask!

Edit 1: Regarding the comparison of Feldenkrais, LSVT Big, and other physical exercises to AT:
Her work does focus on combining AT with both of them and eventually comparing the progress practitioners make with/without the foundation of AT. Feldenkrais was a student of FM Alexander, and it has developed into a more exercise-based work. LSVT is similar in that it focuses a lot on the physical exercises, and both these methods are excellent, but with AT you get the extra step of it being foundational for those and other physical exercise programs. Often LSVT (and Feldenkrais to a certain extent) don't change the base habits of the practitioner, and LSVT especially can often only be accessible for those students with a certain amount of function. 

Alexander Technique follows a ""change first, then exercise"" method,so it becomes accessible for all stages/progressions of Parkinson's. In certain cases, such as Phil's, it has actually reversed some symptoms of PD. Obviously any movement/physical exercise is helpful to a patient, but the extra bit of knowledge that Alexander Technique increases how efficient/effective that physical exercise can be. That being said, our intention is to perform further long-term and comparative studies, and our current project succeeding is a part of whether or not we will be able to continue that to the extent that we would like/plan.",2019-04-25 00:07:51

I’m 21 years old and my dad got diagnosed with early on set Parkinson’s and kept it a secret. He also suffered from a heart attack when I was a kid so I thought it was the after math of that.

Slowly his health started getting worse, he couldn’t drive, had to stop working. And had frequent visits to the doctor until he finally told me. I cried all night, without him knowing because I was so scared. 

The problem is, since then I have tried to tell him to go to a physiotherapist, a dietitian, and many other things in order to help him.

He goes once, and then is inconsistent, all he does is sit in front of the tv all day, and his feet are swollen like a balloon. it sucks because I’m literally watching my dad die in front of my eyes, while all my friend’s dads are working hard and joining them at public events. 

I don’t know what to do to ease his suffering, I see it in his eyes how bad it is. I know he’s depressed, and to make things worse he has a lump in his prostate. And was put on medication for it, but because it did not decrease in size he needs surgery, but he won’t do it because he’s scared to be on a colostomy bag. He’s scared I think because it’s a 50/50 chance of failure due to the Parkinson’s... otherwise it’s a 90% success rate. 

What should I do I’m still a student but I feel like I have so much on my plate right now, I have to be the family earner as well. What can I do.. any help is appreciated, I’m just tired of crying at this point thinking about the fact my dads young, and when I get married he won’t have a dance with me, or be able to share moments with me.

She was diagnosed in Oct 18'?...I'm already loosing track  Anyways, even though she has been on medication(dosage trial and error) since then, we've made ZERO freaking strides to having her mobility improve or her overall day to day quality of life.  

I seriously don't get it.  It's effecting my mom's mental health as she's sees no improvement.  Therapist appointments really haven't worked.  She's having panic attacks now.----- We literally went from her walking with a cane, to her being helpless without a specialized walker(even then she still needs help).

She has an upcoming appointment with her neuro(movement disorder specialist) and I'm really considering not going, because I'd probably lash out at her doctor for not finding a good medication fit.  

If you compare her to other Parkinson patients(where she goes for group support), she's probably the youngest one there but others around here are WAY more mobile/fit.

Meanwhile, it's 10pm and she's in bed.  Even with a CPAP/BIPAP machine, I can hear her struggle to breathe...and in the event that I need to help her get up and take her to the bathroom, there is a 50/50 chance she'll fall without my help.  

She thinks that I am mad at her.  I don't.  I'm mad at the diagnosis we got and angry at how doctors are going about treating her.

When she was first diagnosed, doctors told her it would be about 10-15 years before things got severe and while that seemed like a long way away, 2 years later I feel like things have gotten worse faster than I’ve expected. Her driving has gotten less controlled and she’s already fallen at work after losing her balance one day (she’s a first grade teacher).  She’s processed her diagnosis and has done lots of research on what she can do to reduce the symptoms, she’s even part of a support group and a clinical trial to get involved in the community, but she comes home from work so sore and tired that she really has trouble motivating herself to exercise and combat the illness. 

My mom is single and I am the oldest child so she’s been coming to me the most for emotional support, but even after 2 years I don’t even feel like I’ve quite processed it myself yet, and Im trying to be strong so that she doesn’t get discouraged, but every time she talks to me about her struggles I just want to cry. My grandfather fought Parkinson’s for my entire life, so I’ve seen the decline that comes with the illness all the way to the end, and imagining my mom in the same position as him, especially without a spouse to take care of her and support her, breaks my heart and terrifies me all at once.

Right now I go to school about 6 hours away, and even though my plan is to move much closer to home once I graduate, I feel very guilty about not being there to help motivate her and support her in her daily life. I really just want to know what the best way is to provide support from a distance and how people have processed their loved ones’ diagnoses.

I did everything I could to take care of him, changing his soiled sheets, rubbing his back, changing his diaper every night. But this last December I couldn't manage the responsibility any longer, and placed him in a nursing home. 

While at the nursing home, my dad suffered multiple falls and was eventually hospitalized. After the hospitalization,  he was put into a rehab center. The staff at the rehab center were fantastic. My dad didn't want to leave after the 21 days Medicare pays for, and all the nurses sent him a card after he left. The nurses always said my dad was the sweetest guy, and being his son I know they weren't wrong about that! 

After the rehab facility, my dad was moved to a Medicaid pending nursing home. He has been there for 3 months. He was taken to the hospital 6 weeks ago because he said he wanted to kill himself, but was released after a day. He is now on hospice and is down to 100 pounds. He fell out of bed 2 weeks ago and broke his hip, but the doctors say it isn't worth fixing because he will not recover.  

My dad created a good relationship with every person he met. I am proud to be his son. 

I wish I could encapsulate this disease into a living being and torture it for taking my dad away from me. 

I want to end the pain of seeing him in pain but the hospice nurse yesterday said, ""well we don't live in Washington State, and until he is within 48 hours of passing we can't take him to the hospice house."" (Hospice house is where you go to get morphine dripped to death) .

Sadly, the doctors she is able to see here in the US are limited because 

1) she has a language barrier and doctors are not taking her seriously (one gave her anxiety medicine, saying that her symptoms were made up in her head) 

2) her insurance seems to limit her in the type of places she can go to for aggressive scanning. 

&#x200B;

She's already gotten a brain MRI, and everything came back pretty normal (except for a ""normal and expected level of brain deterioration due to her age - 60 yo""), so the one Korean-speaking neurologist she could go to have officially told her to stop being so dramatic.

Hi r/Parkinsons, i've been experiencing some symptoms that i think could possibly be early parkinsons symptoms. I  feel quite confused/not myself, i feel more unsteady on my feet compared to usual, i have noticed mild tremors in fingers where as the fingers just move back and for while im using my phone as well as  my finger tremoring while swiping on my phone , aswell as my hands  being quite shaky  holding an object. This has been ongoing for about 2 months; the tremors effect both hands equally. I have noticed that if i rest my legs in different positions it can be quite a challenge to keep them entirely still. For the past 3 months I've been sleeping much less than i used to be able to sleep well into the day anywhere from 7-12 hours (bad i know) but now I'm lucky to get anywhere between 4-7 and i usually end up waking up say after 3 hours and then going back to sleep to get the other 3, i also have been remembering my dreams as well as this i've had 3 
hypnopompic hallucinations. 

I've had numbness and pins and needles in my legs, feet and hands. I've had internal tremors in my legs and hands/arms. I've had fasiculations over my entire body, my mouth has felt quite tight, and i'd say my voice has become quieter. I've always had  a fairly croaky voice. My father has a very mild neurological issue with his neck but its so mild no one notices as well as his mother having dementia.
I dont get tremors when my hands are at rest maybe a finger moving a little, but i do get a more of uncomfortable feeling when they are in that position.

This procedure treats Parkinson's and not just tremor. I only had my right brain treated (left body) but I can go back and get side 2 done in a year if needed, however there is a chance that my right body will also correct. My rigidity is pretty much gone - I felt that about half way through the procedure, my fine motor is 90% back on the left and was already pretty good on the right, my tremor is 90% better on the left, it is actually worse on my good, right side now (but not worse than it was before). My dyskinesis is 90% reduced on the left and about 70% reduced on the right and I have already reduced by meds by 25% and may be able to stop completely. Over the next 3-6 months there will be some ups and downs as my body adjusts but overall I will continue to improve and as my right brain normalizes there is a good chance my left brain will follow. I have gone from not being able to walk distances, stand still or work to feeling pretty close to being a normal person 📷:-) And so far his work has shown a stability of symptoms from when people stabilize for six years ( and maybe longer, he has only done this six years).

Abstract
Objective

To understand the safety, putaminal coverage, and enzyme expression of adeno‐associated viral vector serotype‐2 encoding the complementary DNA for the enzyme, aromatic L‐amino acid decarboxylase (VY‐AADC01), delivered using novel intraoperative monitoring to optimize delivery.

Methods

Fifteen subjects (three cohorts of 5) with moderately advanced Parkinson's disease and medically refractory motor fluctuations received VY‐AADC01 bilaterally coadministered with gadoteridol to the putamen using intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance to visualize the anatomic spread of the infusate and calculate coverage. Cohort 1 received 8.3 × 1011vg/ml and ≤450 μl per putamen (total dose, ≤7.5 × 1011vg); cohort 2 received the same concentration (8.3 × 1011vg/ml) and ≤900 μl per putamen (total dose, ≤1.5 × 1012vg); and cohort 3 received 2.6 × 1012vg/ml and ≤900 μl per putamen (total dose, ≤4.7 × 1012vg). (18)F‐fluoro‐L‐dihydroxyphenylalanine positron emission tomography (PET) at baseline and 6 months postprocedure assessed enzyme activity; standard assessments measured clinical outcomes.

Results

MRI‐guided administration of ascending VY‐AADC01 doses resulted in putaminal coverage of 21% (cohort 1), 34% (cohort 2), and 42% (cohort 3). Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 showed corresponding increases in enzyme activity assessed by PET of 13%, 56%, and 79%, and reductions in antiparkinsonian medication of –15%, –33%, and –42%, respectively, at 6 months. At 12 months, there were dose‐related improvements in clinical outcomes, including increases in patient‐reported ON‐time without troublesome dyskinesia (1.6, 3.3, and 1.5 hours, respectively) and quality of life.

Interpretation

Novel intraoperative monitoring of administration facilitated targeted delivery of VY‐AADC01 in this phase 1 study, which was well tolerated. Increases in enzyme expression and clinical improvements were dose dependent.

I believe this halting, and outright cure of PD and movement disorders may come in two different areas.

1. Eliminating gut dysbiosis by establishing a good microbiome via fecal transplant (this is a Reddit post I created linking a lot of the positive research regarding PD and fecal transplants/gut dysbiosis correction in one place - read when you have some time): 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Parkinsons/comments/9dnvi0/tremendous_link_between_neurological_disorders/

2. Stem cells directly injected into the substantia nigra (or another relevant section of the brain) to repair or outright regrow the damaged dopamine producing neurons in that region of the brain:

There is a trial that started this year (2019) regarding fecal transplants to restore gut microbiome to treat Parkinsons disease: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03808389

Stem cells have shown to work in animal models but are there any current human clinical trials involving stem cells treating Parkinson's disease and humans? Yes, and some of the trials are projected to have results in 2019.

One day she turned the oven on and left the house, leaving it on. She's always been very careful about that sort of thing, checking and double checking. She seemed slightly concerned, but not enough to really think much about it outside of worrying about the house burning down.

Then yesterday, I went to put something in the dishwasher, and she'd put her trash on the top rack, instead of into the trashcan nearby. This is very out of character for her, but she brushed it off again.

&#x200B;

Let me preface this by saying I am a computer science student at a university in Canada, and I want to create a project to help people with some of the physical struggles that they have. Also, **any project that I create will be free to use,** as I am not motivated by money. I came here in hope that some of you, people you know, or patients that you have, can provide some inspiration for a project.

&#x200B;

This will be a summer project so I will have a considerable amount of time to work on this, at least 4 months, and I am more than happy to continue working on it during the year if it is not finished.

&#x200B;

One such idea that I have is an app that stabilizes the screens of phones for people with tremors. Similar to this [device](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiVQcgmIi08). I imagine that people with hand tremors will have a tough time reading from phones and devices, if they are not already placed on a sturdy object. This program will try to stabilize text using by moving the text on the screen in the opposite direction of their tremours using iPhones [gyroscope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORcu-c-qnjg) and accelerometer technology. If I cannot use that technology for some reason, I will attempt to demo this product on an Arduino or raspberry pi.

&#x200B;

Is this idea practical, or will this have no effect in the hands of someone with tremors?

&#x200B;

Also, if someone has any other difficulties and struggles with daily life and technology, even if they don't have an idea to fix it, please comment down below.

I’m writing because I am hoping to get some advice on getting doctors to listen to you, even when you are young for possible Parkinson’s onset. 

About 6 years ago I started developing symptoms, mostly just an essential tremor, which I know is no big deal. No worries, move on. About 3 years ago essential tremor becomes a resting tremor. Again, not the most concerning thing, so, got it checked out and moved on. About a year and a half ago start noticing some mild tremors in my face and clumsiness with my tongue, along with hand weakness, and I start to get more concerned, but I checked in with my PCP and she said that it’s probably just stress or a vitamin deficiency, and we will keep an eye on it. 

But, things have developed. In about the past six months, my right arm has become essentially glued to my side, and I’m getting tightness traveling up my arm into the shoulder. It’s effecting my posture and walking, as my arm no longer swings on the right side. I’ve fallen a few times because my gate tends to lean forward and I don’t pick up my feet much. And I’m tired, just all the time. I have increasing tremors in my hand, face, and calf/thigh muscles on the right side. 

I have three great grandparents with Parkinson’s and two grandparents with it. I know it’s not purely genetic, but it is part of my background. 

I went to the neurologist a few weeks ago, and had brain and spinal MRIs done with few conclusions (one brain lesion). MS has been pretty much ruled out along with Sjogren’s, Lyme, and a B12 deficiency. 

My doctor didn’t bring up Parkinson’s at all, and from my reading (I fully recognize that I do not have a medical degree, and know very little diagnostics), it sounds like a possibility. When I brought it up to her, she said no. When I asked why, she stated that I was too young to have Parkinson’s. 

To me this is a very dismissive answer, and implies that we are taking a possible diagnosis off of the table, for a reason that isn’t very sound in my book. Had it been based on a clinical rule out or a lack of meeting criteria, great, I take that and move on, but it really was just based on age. 


I guess my question is, how do I get the doctor to take my symptoms seriously? They are really beginning to impact my daily living and my education (I’m a doctoral student) and I feel like I am being dismissed simply based on my age. Any ideas? I’m thinking about going to a different neurologist, but I want to avoid doctor shopping.

Dad was diagnosed 6 years ago (he is 57 now) and disease has progressed quite a bit. As a child and teenager he was a lot into sports, so he has always been active and healthy. He practiced at a semi-competitive level several sports such a cycling, swimming and athletics. He's always been caring and hand-working. When he married my mom, they were relatively poor, and he managed to open a business and bring it up from a garage sandwich shop to having 5 medium sized restaurants around the city. He walked 45 minutes to work and 45 back everyday because he wanted to stay healthy, he worked his ass off 14 hours a day, 7 days a week for around 20 years to achieve this, and it feels terribly unfair that this happened to him. 

He had DBS surgery (Boston medical) a couple years ago, he was thoroughly evaluated to determine if he qualified as a patient since not everyone does, and we were so glad he did. We were all excited at first, and did see some progress, but not much. We were told by the specialist that programming was a slow process, because they had to find the exact combination of some sort of numbers I don't really understand to calibrate his motor functions properly, and even then, the disease would keep on progressing so he would have to be programmed again. Thing is he never got to feel comfortable. Symptons were reduced only slightly, like 20% if I'd had to put a number.  He has lost 80% of his voice volume, and has a lot of trouble taking care for himself (including showering, changing clothes, going to the bathroom, etc).

Recently though, I saw a video of Jimmy Choi  ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK00vGeXamc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK00vGeXamc)), a guy who, from my perspective, defeated Parkinson's almost completely just by exercising everyday, and a bit more everyday. If you haven't seen it, I highly suggest you see it. I showed this to my dad, and he was very motivated at first. He started walking 5 min a day everyday with my mom, but soon he started to complain about stomach aches and leg cramps and stuff the didn't let him walk. Now he doesn't even leave his bed, he is depressed, doesn't want to eat at the table with the family, doesn't want to see his mom and sisters, etc. Kind of feels like he's given up. Just recently he asked for a clinical bed to be installed in him room, which we did. Now he spends more time laid watching TV and doing nothing. 

What I am looking for in this post is stories of success that could motivate him. I remember seeing a video similar to Jimmy Choi's case but I can't find it again. Of course, advise, tips and anything else is greatly appreciated. Things me and my family can help with, ways to have fun with him, get him to talk, and emotionally motivate him. On the  medical part, he is seeing experienced specialists that I have seen have a lot of success with other patients, so no doubt there.

I need help. 

I (26f) and my fiancé (26m) moved in with my parents after renting for a while to help out with my dad and the day to day life is taxing to say the least. It’s temporary but I’m wondering if his symptoms are common.

He was a super hard-working man. Always a little too sensitive but would work 80 hour weeks, etc, he was always capable and physically active. He got diagnosed probably 10yrs ago and was okay for a while. In the past 5 years, though, it has progressed like crazy. Multiple care accidents leading to the revocation of his license (and crazy high insurance bills for my poor mom); forced into early retirement because he worked in a prison and could no longer hack the physical requirements; cut pension, due to early retirement; constant falls, etc. Now he is 60. In the past year, he has declined like CRAZY. 

He hallucinates. Constantly. He sees people. He’ll run outside because he thinks he’s being held hostage. He can sometimes understand they’re not real but sometimes he can’t. He can barely move most days. He seems crazily cognitively impaired these days, doing things I’ve only heard of people deep within dimentia doing. For instance, touching raw chicken and then not washing his hands. Leaving remnants of food all over the kitchen and not seeing it. Leaving random wrappers and stuff in the oven and then preheating it. He his crazy mood swings (he always had a strange temper but this is ludicrous); he is severely delusional most days, thinking my mom is sneering at him or cheating on him, things that were never ever an issue before. He touches his phone constantly (with raw-chicken or food covered hands, mind) and will tap things, accidentally buy things, call people. He seems like he’s SO incapable of caring for himself anymore. 

None of us are in the position to be home with him. My mom is so young, only on her mid 50s, and plans to work for a long time because she can and because they need her income. Their marriage is nonexistent. It’s like he went from being 40 to 90 overnight. He doesn’t tolerate her having her own life well, either, and gets really really jealous when she can’t or won’t devote every second to him (this is horrible to say, but sometimes it seems like his cognitive symptoms are worse in those moments??? Like it’s partly attention seeking at times???). 

I just don’t know how to help them anymore. His physical symptoms are bad but his cognitive symptoms are SOOO much worse. It’s getting to the point where I personally think a nursing home would better suit him but then he says things like, “I’ll kill myself first.” That’s not who he is at all but his personality and capabilities have changed so much that I’m not sure I’d put it past him. 

Is any of this normal? I’ve done my research, I know we are looking at Parkinsonian dimentia. I’m a social worker so I’m not totally knew to case management stuff like this. But am I jumping the gun talking about nursing homes?",2019-03-18 08:21:21

The aim of the application I have developed is estimating the risk of cancer for any individual based on all the risk factors that can be found in the scientific literature. It includes 250 different risk factors and can calculate the risk for 26 different cancers. It also gives you a breakdown of each of those risks by showing you all the risk factors influencing it (both positive and negative) with detailed figures, possible lifestyle changes one could make and references. It is completely free and does not transmit any information to us or any other party.

So it pains me to see him hurting constantly and i try to do what i can to help. When he sleeps he can not sleep in a bed because it pains him so he sleeps in a chair/recliner. How ever when he falls asleep his neck kinda goes a weird way and due to the way his back is shaped it causes him to breathe weird and he often wakes up complaining about neck pain. Also he randomly in his sleep scream or laugh or talk to someone random. So i have two questions. 1.Should i get him something to help him sleep at night like a neck pillow or something along the lines of that. 2.

686,Making fists: confirming or assuaging fears,KuzcoJo,5,azmy3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parkinsons/comments/azmy3i/making_fists_confirming_or_assuaging_fears/,5,1552295019.0,"My wife (age 33) is concerned that she has early onset Parkinson’s (plenty of reasons, but I won’t go into them all for the purpose of this specific question). She has tremors in her non-dominant pinky and ring fingers. She has difficulty making a fist with this hand, and the act of making a fist can trigger the tremors.

My very limited understanding is that Parkinson’s tremors are resting tremors. My question, for those who have been diagnosed with Parkinson’s and have tremors, is this: what effect does making a fist have on your tremors?  Do you have difficulties making fists? If so, is it a weakness issue, or do the tremors make it difficult to do so? Does making a fist bring on the tremors, stop the tremors, or replicate the symptoms of the tremors? Is there a correlation between my wife’s issues with making a fist and Parkinson’s? Could this be another confirmatory sign that she has Parkinson’s?

I hope this question/issue makes sense. I’m a novice when it comes to Parkinson’s, but I’m more scared than I am ignorant, so I would be grateful for any feedback. My sincerest thanks.",2019-03-11 09:03:39

My dad was diagnosed with Parkinson's 2-3 years ago and I think he's had symptoms for 4 years. Age is mid 50's. My parents relocated to Seattle right as he was starting to show symptoms and he hasn't been able to get job since he left his old one. He can't even check his email b/c of some sort of anxiety, I'm not totally clear on this. He can't handle social situations with other people at all. 

My mom works during the day and takes care of him when she's home. When his medicine is wearing off he basically lays in bed because any sort of coordinated movement is difficult and he has a lot of brain fog. He spends most of his time watching videos on an iPad. He goes to the gym maybe 3 times a week if it's a good week and tries to vigorously exercise though he doesn't really break a sweat because his for some reason heart rate doesn't go up very much. He have no social circle here due to the move. 

He was a very hard working person, very driven, loved his job, outgoing. Now I feel like he's just sitting around waiting to die. Maybe I'm wrong but it feels like his progression is really fast. I tried to get him to go to rock steady boxing but they both say that his current gym membership is cheaper and he doesn't like change in his routine, like figuring out a new bus route.  They're waiting for when he's feeling better to maybe try boxing. I don't think that's going to happen and realistically neither do they. Am I putting too much hope into maybe having him go boxing and meet other people with Parkinson's would help him mentally and physically? They are very money sensitive since only my mom works but I've already offered to help them pay for it.

I live far away and only visit a couple times a year. I didn't even know he started walking with a walker. I feel like he's not taking enough medicine for the symptoms to be managed and he just tries to tough it out most of the day, I'm not sure about the side effects or how the medicine works but they're convinced if he takes too much medicine then he'll become more resistant to it faster. They're wary of medicine because when he first started going to his doctor something he got prescribed caused him to lose a ton of weight and he was already thin. 

What can I be doing to help them?  I feel like he is much too young for the disease to progress so fast. ",2019-03-09 05:51:45

Each baby gets 24 eye drops followed by a device that forces the eye open and a ""spoon"" that pushes the eyeball to the side so that the doctor can see behind it.  It is imperative that the person holding the baby on his or her knees during the examination is absolutely still.  It is awful to watch.  My hip dysplasia does not allow me to keep my knees together and steady to hold the babies during the exam. I talked to my dad about my dilemma and a few hours later he sent me this [pic](https://imgur.com/gallery/rnnIAbQ). The only reason he was hesitant to help was because of his Parkinson's disease.  He practiced in his bedroom and was able to hold steady with a belt around his legs.  The examination was successful and he was back at it again two weeks later.

However ... recently she's been having extreme emotional outsbursts, always relation to her inability to use her laptop. She has never been tech savvy but will not seem to accept my explanation that all her current issues are related to her motor issues. She calls her computer 'dumb' and 'broken' and twice (!) today came to me, sobbing in tears (and not for the first time), because she could not close a webpage ... because she was closing the whole browser, and when you do that and reopen it, it opens to the same page. I told her that clearly in the morning, and demonstrated it for her, and she came to me, again sobbing, this evening about the same issue.

This is not a tech support question--I'm aware I can turn off the feature, it is not the only one she has cried over--it is an emotional one. Are these symptoms of the progression of the disease? Mental decline? one of her medications? A symptom of normal stress? I'm aware the conclusive answer will be ""ask her doctor"", I'm just trying to see if anyone else has experienced something similar?

He also has developed some stiffness, and a bulging  midriff that has made it difficult for him to get up from bed, stand up from his chair and sit down easily. He's somewhat stable walking around the house, but it's the transitions that cause the most instability.

&#x200B;

1. I am thinking of getting him a walker that he can use to stabilize himself when he wants to sit or lean on when he is feeling unstable while walking. Does anyone have experience if this helps? I've heard of others having a fall with a walker, and I am nervous. Should I look into a 4-based walking stick? 

&#x200B;

2. Not sure if I am overtdoing it, but am looking at fall-proofing the house by making the area around the bed covered with carpet and removing sharp edged furniture. Also, putting some hand bars everywhere that he can hold on to

&#x200B;

3. To improve his core strength, will continue with PT and increase his aided walks. Losing weight and working on flexibility needs to become a focus

&#x200B;

Any thoughts or suggestions? Thanks in advance

Hi there,

&#x200B;

Just wanted to figure out what your number 1 problem is having PD. I want to start a business around creating a solution.

As a son of a father who has Parkinson's, I can say that the problem we struggle most with is employment and finding things to do at home to pass the time.

738,Having a hard time finding palliative/hospice care for end stage parkinson's disease ... hospice group literally booted patient off service when caretaker needed respite after her own emergency cancer surgery. halp?,Obedient_Human,3,at1psu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parkinsons/comments/at1psu/having_a_hard_time_finding_palliativehospice_care/,3,1550774328.0,"Hi there,

First post, and I wish it were of something better or different.  I'm trying to support a friend, as I had my dad pass away last year and know how the process is just .... trying.  But I was on the east coast then.  Here I'm on the west coast and I would think people would be more advanced or caring somehow... but that hasn't been what this family has experienced.  My heart is breaking for them.

&#x200B;

I have been helping them out for the last month, and got her dad out of the hospital.  He was being physically and chemically restrained to be just 'quiet' and easier for the staff to deal with.  I'd never met him before.... but I can tell you by the time I got his neurologist there and acting responsibly, he changed dramatically in a day.  People don't understand that parkinson's meds need to be given regularly.  He was missing meds for days and he was lucky to make it home at all. 

&#x200B;

Transitioning to home hospice we hoped would be better... because how could it not? That was something.  But I'm struggling here seeing that this guy has great healthcare coverage (not actually medicare eligible and has private insurance), and has long term care through his work for being a state engineer.  These are down to earth, sweet, caring public servants... and I'm watching in horror as they get run over.  He is suddenly bed bound and unable to do anything much for himself, and his wife had emergency surgery and needed extra help.  I showed up and been trying really hard to do something, to get some help.  There was supposed to be a meeting with the hospice group to assign respite care in the morning, and that night we were stranded and I got lucky with finding a care agency to pay out of pocket for help so he wouldn't have to sit in his own waste all night long.  

&#x200B;

But the morning meeting never happened.  Instead, they waited and waited until the end of the afternoon, and called not his daughter or myself who had been reaching out to them, but the wife who has been I think tearing stitches from being unable to rest after the surprise cancer surgery... and unceremoniously dumping him from their hospice service.  I have a day and a half, not even, to somehow get a hospital bed for this guy and people to help put him into it, never mind all the rest.  And he's fully aware and able to talk and reason and say how he feels... and he's been just struggling.  This whole family has been.  They even had gotten a patient care case manager that didn't really help them so much as take their money and not make sure the services were covered by insurance.  

&#x200B;

What do people do in times like this? How can an agency that is supposed to be so highly esteemed just turn their backs on people in need? I don't understand this.  Hospice is either different than I've experienced it in other states or it has changed a lot in this state in the last decade.  I know, for example, that there was that lawsuit against medicare to get PD patients covered physical therapy during hospice because PD is degenerative and there are complications with many medications. That was in 2012.  They won.  But I don't see anyone here that cares.  Or wants to help.  And we are in the hub of technological advancement, here.  

&#x200B;

Where do people go for help? What can we do? I'm seeing this overstressed system and trying to give people the benefit of the doubt they are trying their best... but how do people find end of life care for those with parkinson's who understand parkinson's?

&#x200B;

Thanks,

\-me

I am writing to ask for some help and some insights regarding symptoms from those who were diagnosed with early onset. I have been diagnosed with essential tremor and postural tremor, but am not entirely satisfied with these diagnoses, given the odd nature of my symptoms, as well as the lack of concern and focus shown to me by my neurologist. I feel that I have a resting tremor, though it is so sporadic it is hard to catch in the act on video.

My pinky and ring finger tend to tremor more than my other fingers on my non dominant hand. They can get especially frustrating following periods of high stress or sleep loss, which I’ve heard is not uncommon of many different types of tremor, including Parkinson’s tremor and essential tremor. However, my question is this: for those who have been diagnosed with early onset, do those fingers also feel painful at times, with pain radiating up the arm? Do those fingers also feel weak to you? Do you struggle to grasp and hold things requiring those fingers, such as making a fist, holding a glass, holding the steering wheel, etc? These aren’t symptoms of essential tremor, that I know of, but are not taken seriously by my neurologist, and so I’m pursuing my health looking into other potential causes. Perhaps, one of the reasons my tremor is so bothersome is because it is also painful. 

One possibility for the pain is cubital tunnel syndrome, which is a possibility expressed by my doctor, though that does not explain the coming and going of symptoms or the feeling I get associated with a resting tremor.

I am grateful for your insights. Wishing you all the best on your journey.",2019-02-20 08:28:55

The main problem that we're suffering from are massive blood pressure drops following him standing, normally to visit the toilet. These drops are causing him to black out and collapse, leading to severe damage to body.

Following a visit to his specialist his Midodrine dosage was increased in an attempt to counter these effects, however  **following the dosage increase the blackouts have increased considerably** contra to the expected effect. Has anyone else experienced a similar effect with this medication?

Is this something people deal with?  This mood swing?

She did start taking this sleeping pill that the doctor prescribed her ( he said it was normally for schizophrenic symptoms) But we split the pill, let her fall asleep normally and when she needs it later in the night we give her half because it can cause prolonged drowsiness.

I have decided to try meds again and would like advice on best timing, ie. what time to take pills. 

I have been taking meds to help with right hand tremor and some stiffness. I stopped taking carbidopa levodopa last summer. At the time I was taking 4 to 5 tabs daily and had issues with nausea; one day I forgot my meds and after a week without meds decided they had not been helping and my symptoms were not very bad.

This was disturbing because I thought I had a medical treatment which turned out to be a placebo effect. Better to know it wasn’t working, but I felt unrooted, like I had no treatment available.

In the past 40 days I have been noticing worsening symptoms, a dullness in my gait and lack of quickness. In fitness class I am unable to cycle faster than 85 rpm, where even last year I could achieve 110 rpm. In step aerobics I can’t keep pace with the quickest footwork.

Please share advice on best med schedule, I am going to be taking my carbi-levodopa. I think taking 1 pill 7 am, and then 1 after breakfast 8 am, then a pill every 4 hours. Do you take pills before bed? Is it crucial to take on empty stomach (I get nauseous)? I know I can’t rely on others for medical advice, but I’d love to hear of tactics and successes.",2019-02-03 08:04:10

780,One Year Later(Dad got his DBS back!),mamastrawb,8,am9v8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parkinsons/comments/am9v8t/one_year_laterdad_got_his_dbs_back/,2,1549103998.0,"So it's my dad's birthday today, which means it's one year since he had his DBS removed. More info can be found on my first [post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parkinsons/comments/7vkdqd/dbs_temporarily_removed/), and I posted an [update \~6 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parkinsons/comments/8wyihj/dad_finally_came_home_after_having_dbs_removed/), and figured it was time for a final update. 

Dad got his DBS put back in in September, then it was a few months of programming every two weeks, now we appear to have achieved more-or-less a new normal. Unfortunately he's not getting any PT/OT right now, but soon he will be going to a PT facility(for a few months we had a small army of PT's, OT's, and nurses coming weekly) so he can learn how to use stairs. He mostly uses his walker to get around, recently he's started to go without on occasion. 

Dad is definitely not at the level he was before all this happened. Beyond less physical ability, he's much more mentally gone. He has moments where he seems more *here*, but for the most part he's a one-word response kinda guy now. But if you had asked my family from Feb-April, we would have told you we did not think he was going to survive at all. When I think of the zombie-like state he was in, completely unresponsive to anything we said or did, feeding tube, breathing tube, so *gaunt*....Being able to just ask him how he's doing and get a response feels like such a gift. 

As I said, it's his birthday, on Sunday the whole family will be getting together to have chinese takeout and play some board games. He and my mom take day trips once a month or so the town they grew up in, to visit his brother and enjoy a day away. We took him to the movies a couple weeks ago for the first time, and now I'm eager to start going regularly again, as he's my primary movie buddy and we missed a lot of good ones in 2018. In December we took our annual trip to Hocking Hills State Park, and he enjoyed the wheelchair accessible trails.

All through 2018 I kept having to tell my mother: All we're required to do right now is survive. It doesn't matter if the house is a mess, or you keep missing days at work, or you feel bad that your friend cooked us a dozen casseroles because we have no time to grocery shop...None of that matters. We've just gotta survive this. 

And we did.

And he did. 

And now we get to start living again. ",2019-02-02 10:39:58

Hey all.  I was recently diagnosed back in the fall of 2018.  My neurologist put me on Rytary and Domperidone(I had to order this from Canada).  He had my titrate up to 195mg x 6 per day. 

 Ever since I got to higher levels I started feeling like I was cold all over.  The kind of cold like you would have with chills.  It's bad enough that I have to wear sweatpants, a sweater and multiple blankets--sometimes with a heating pad to abate the symptoms.  Even then the feeling lasts for an hour or two.


Has anyone experienced this?  My doctor has said it's likely caused by low BP or thyroid, but I've been checked for the thyroid and I monitor my BP when I get cold.

So basically it would be relaxed during rest, and once initiation of movement began, it would activate, either passively by resisting all joint movement, or actively by monitoring for specific types of movements (like jolts or repeated tremors)

 However, I was concerned that such a device would make the execution of voluntary movement more difficult.

811,Seriously considering FMT at private clinic,bestbone44,14,ah2kuz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parkinsons/comments/ah2kuz/seriously_considering_fmt_at_private_clinic/,22,1547788380.0,"Recently diagnosed and have been reading around the subject.  The theory of PD starting in the gut due to some environmental event such as pesticides or repeated antibiotics causing microbiome imbalance seems plausible given the reasearch on how cutting the vagus nerve gives a strong protection statistically against PD.   Also the research that PD patients have an unbalanced microbiome is very interesting. 

I have now ordered a stool test to see if my micobiome matches the population distribution found in the research papers for PD. If it does, I am seriously considering FMT at a private clinic.  Note I have no gut issues at all such as constipation.

Thought on this please.  Has anyone else done such an analysis, or tried FMT ?

I think this is my second post on here and I just want to thank you all for the support. I live abroad in Europe and my father who has Parkinson's lives back in the US where I grew up with my mother and my older sister and niece. He was diagnosed about two years ago but I went home this past Christmas and saw a huge decline in his health. He has trouble holding conversations, having head and facial movements and just overall seems not so much in tune with anything going on around him 90% of the time....he is still ""working"" at his restaurant he owns but I heard it is basically just giving him something to do even if he can not get much done anymore. Sometimes he even drives to work, but everyone tries as much as they can to drive him in. This is also a growing concern that he may have to give up driving soon. Unfortunately he lives in a city where you NEED a car because public transportation is basically non existent.

&#x200B;

To give you some background info on me... I am 26 years old and just completed my masters degree, moved back to a city where I feel really great and has potential just in November and I just moved in to a new apartment with my boyfriend of 2.5 years. However, my job is not anything I am passionate about. Just thankful for. However, with this job, I will need to move to another part of the country by April and stay there with this company. It's a marketing position for a very small company (only 5 of us in total in the whole company including my 2 bosses) I teach English online and also do the marketing for another company that is in the field that I studied. However, I can do both of these jobs online and anywhere and honestly make pretty good money from it if I start focusing on them more instead of my day-to-day 9-6 job I have right now.. My dad is my best friend and knowing that each time I go home, there will be a greater decline, just kills me. I feel like it would be a selfish move to stay here just because I have A job. Not THE job of my dreams or anything. I am in a really great place with my boyfriend and he understands how hard it is for me to be so far from my dad so he obviously supports my decision. Plus, distance definitely make the heart grow fonder....Because I don't feel super passionate about the job I have now, just makes me want to quit and go home this summer. Even if it puts the company in a pretty shitty position....Even if it is only for 2-3 months, it is during the peak season of the company and I wouldn't be able to just take a break and go home for the summer. I think it is worth it to go home....I need some advice...Basically, i'm assuming with Parkinson's time is of the essence. I just want to be with him as much as I can, talk with him, share memories and tell stories. Even if I have to put my life on hold for just a summer. I know it is not a decision I will regret for spending time with my dad but sometimes I wonder about my life and just how much I will be losing from going home.

&#x200B;

I will be going home for two weeks in March....maybe I could think about it then....talk to my family about it and see what they say but sometimes I know what I SHOULD do.",2019-01-16 23:19:31

I have been active in two Rock Steady Boxing gyms since my diagnosis. I am quick to tell you that there are many positive things that come from working out  with other Parkinson's patients, especially social, since we are all going through the same thing. 

My first gym is about 1000 miles away where I lived when I got diagnosed little over two and a half years ago. Since I live so far away I like to keep in touch by following that gym on social media. It's becoming difficult to watch.

 One of my friends who is so larger-than-life in many ways has lost his speech and his ability to walk independently. Another is moving into a facility as she and her husband are no longer able to live on their own. When someone doesn't show up to the gym for a few sessions in a row it's more than curiosity when we ask about them. What happened? Is he okay? Will he come back? Will it happen to me?

There is nothing that can be done other than share in the joy of their successes and share in the sorrow of their losses. I am also acutely aware that those close to me are doing the same thing as they watch me progress.

I'm using a throwaway account as my family likes to keep this topic hush hush and I'm just following suit.

&#x200B;

Three years ago my father had a confirmed diagnosis for Parkinson's. Initially many of the symptoms he saw he just thought came with age as he is fairly old at this point. However we were proven wrong, and in my research about the disease, I ran into the symptoms of young-onset Parkinsons. It disturbed me to find that many small physical and mental issues I've been having as of late are strongly related to symptoms of young-onset Parkinsons. 

For example, my hands have been shaky for a few years now but I've begun to notice it seems to be getting worse in the past year especially. On occasion when my hands are resting they'll begin shaking, my remedy to this is keeping my hands active. But in the past few months, they'll shake randomly regardless of what I do. As well several times a week I'll feel very active muscle spasms occur in my legs which I also can't control much. This doesnt help the fact that my balance is terrible and I swear I'm tripping or falling over things I never would have before. Sometimes it feels i just literally trip over my own feet. 

What concerns me the most is while my physical issues could be written off as me over thinking things, what I do know for a fact is my memory and mood overall is declining. I havent had a decent night's rest in what feels like years now and it shows through various applications I use to track my sleep. My ability to memorize things has severely degraded, whereas before I could remember most things right away now I have trouble remembering my girlfriend's siblings names, or the birthdays of my best friends of over 10 years. Since my father's diagnosis I also began using various memory testing programs which also show my memory is very steadily declining. 

&#x200B;

I feel these symptoms could be the result of young-onset parkinsons, which would make sense to me at least genetically. I feel I've ticked all the boxes for the symptoms of Young-onset parkinsons except for one. From the averages of age for young-onset parkinsons I seem to be almost too young to be sure if its even possible for it to be diagnosed. 

&#x200B;

Am I just over thinking things or Should i try and get this checked out?

Over the last month or so, I've been wanting to join an Essential Tremors-themed Discord Server since I have ET. However, since a Discord of that nature doesn't exist I chose to make one myself. The Discord Server's intentions are to create a more fluid environment for better communication.  As of yesterday that ***need*** came true. I created a server for **Essential Tremors & Parkinson's.**

 

Discord is a chatting app/website/program. It was originally intended for gamers, but many non-gaming communities use it because it has so many features and is easily the best chatroom service out there right now. Think of it as Reddit combined with Skype. There are lots of discord servers (chatrooms) that people make for specific hobbies, interests, games, etc with their own moderators, admins, etc.

 

To create a Discord account please click this > [HERE](https://discordapp.com/register)  < This link will forward you to the sign-up webpage on Discord's main website. You can either use Discord from within a web browser or you can download the stand-alone app (PC / Phone). After you create a discord account, **OR** if you already have one. Please click on this > [The Nature of Leaves & Flowers](https://discord.gg/4YmNnxd) < This invitation link will give you access to the server. **The name is in reference to how our hands or bodies shake like leaves, and how our mind and well-being can be reflected as a flower in nature.**

 

I don't expect **everyone** to join, but maybe some might be interested. Though, I hope that in the end, I can look back and appreciate the amount of hours I put into creating a solid environment for all of us to enjoy.

I am 45 with PD and trying to get meds working. My movement disorder specialist prescribed the dopamine agonist ropinirole (generic Requip). I’ve been titrating up over the course of four weeks and I am now taking 1mg three times daily. As soon as I increased to this dose I started having visual disturbance side effects. They come in the form of what I guess I’d best describe as flashing lights. I see them briefly when first opening my eyes after being deep asleep. They only last a few seconds. This never happens after I’m fully awake for the day. I tried generic Mirapex previously and discontinued due to the same side effect. As soon as I discontinued the Mirapex the visual disturbances upon wakening stopped. They started up again only after titrating up to 1mg 3x daily of ropinirole. They did not occur at the lower doses. I had a thorough eye exam and my eyes checked out fine. My ophthalmologist wasn’t surprised this was happening and said it was associated with taking DAs and was not dangerous. My movement disorder specialist said she’s never heard of anyone having this side effect. Has anyone else experienced DA induced visual disturbances in the form of flashing lights?

His movements are slower, he seems to shuffle when he walks, and his face has a very flat affect. I’ve noticed cognitive changes too – he makes bad judgment calls when driving, doesn’t always follow conversations, and sleeps a lot. He has trouble making decisions. He previously went to a doctor about tremors in his hands, which were diagnosed as essential tremor, and I’ve noticed facial tremors. There are many other changes I’ve seen as well.

He does have a history of severe depression, but his movements and facial expression are leading me to believe it may be something more – possibly Parkinson’s or Lewy body dementia. 

I’ve reached out to a neurologist who encourages us to seek an evaluation, given the option of effective or promising treatments. 

The problem is I haven’t had a discussion with my father about this. I believe the prospect – and an actual diagnosis – of either Parkinson’s or dementia would devastate him. I am worried he would completely fall apart. 

I want to encourage him to see his GP and get a referral – because if it is something more and treatments are available, I’m hoping he can be helped right away. I’m looking for tips on how to open this very difficult conversation.

Great to see there is an active subreddit on this topic, hopefully one day I can help someone with info. But, today I am very much in the dark and hoping to get some insight from folks here.

I am trying to understand how to help my father who is 67 years old and was diagnosed 3 years ago with Parkinson's. He is retired now but was a consultant 5 years ago, traveling around the world solving very complex problems for F50 companies. Since we noticed the first symptoms maybe 4 years ago, he has lost the ability to effectively communicate complex thoughts/emotions, lost 50lbs (180 --> 130), lost the ability to stand for more than 15 minutes at a time, lost the ability to effectively hold a drink in his right hand, recently got a rash on his back (maybe hives), his blood pressure is all over the place and his eyes dry out which require some type of special and very expensive eye drops. Additionally, due to these symptoms preventing him from doing physical/social activity, he has now become an alcoholic. His personal opinion is that he may have Hashimoto in addition to Parkinson's...and he thinks alcohol has nothing to do with this.

The more I read the more I am concerned this is beyond just PD, but of course that is what good docs are here to decide.

I am currently trying to get a list of official symptoms from my step-mom, but for now I am unable to provide types of medicine he is taking, or specific symptoms noted by doctors.

As far as my next steps, I plan to become very involved. I have not been so far. But, my brothers and I plan to visit him, and simply let him know we do not think this is only related to Parkinson's, and that he has to visit 1 or more very focused specialists over an ongoing & extended period of time to start correctly diagnosing things. Or, if he wants to continue drinking and not get standard things like a colonoscopy, for example, we will not agree with that path. But, we are willing to support him in either direction. However, in the latter scenario, we will be adamant about being involved with planning a better living situation so as to not completely ruin my step-mom's life as she struggles to do everything but wipe him.

Other than pointing out things that may come to mind as you read through the above description (I just don't know so much in the space, please feel free throw the book at me), I would really appreciate this community's thoughts on the following questions:

\- Is it common (or even rare) for Parkinson's to crop up almost immediately and begin to just utterly destroy someone's otherwise physically/mentally active life within 3-5 years?

\- Are there common symptoms seen that appear to be Parkinson's-related, but are often mis-diagnosed?

\- If folks on here did have a multitude of problems/symptoms to handle, how did you effectively go about doing this? Did you need a team of doctor's with various specialities, for example?

\- What advice do you have to combat Parkinson's in general (I've noticed working out seems to be huge)...?

842,I Have Parkinson's And My 'Off' Periods Are Suddenly Getting Longer - HELP!,AnthonyRoberson,15,abvlxq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parkinsons/comments/abvlxq/i_have_parkinsons_and_my_off_periods_are_suddenly/,9,1546479731.0,"I am a 51 year old Male and I have been diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease for about four years now. I take Sinemet, Amantadine, Selgeline and Clonazepam for sleep. My symptoms are mostly right side rigidity, overall pain and trouble sleeping.

I have done remarkably well up until several months ago. I basically took my meds and went on with my life for the most part. However, over the last couple of months, my 'off' periods have suddenly started getting longer. I used to take meds at 7 am and I was good until 12 or 1 pm. Now I am starting to go 'off' by 11 am and so I have to take meds early. This means I go 'off' again before I leave work and it makes it rather hard to drive home...

I am not asking for a medical opinion or advice. I just want to know if anyone that fits my demographic has had a similar experience and what, if anything, they did to help it. I have started walking some but I hurt so bad most of the time that it makes it difficult.

I am pretty despondent at this point. I really can't afford to lose my job but it is getting harder and harder just to make it through the day. Any advice or assistance would be most appreciated.",2019-01-03 01:42:11

I was put on Primidone to deal with the tremors and to help me sleep at night and after about 3 months it started to work less and less until it finally didn’t help me at all.

I currently have no insurance and haven’t been back to the doctor and after my initial visit was about $470 I can’t really go back just yet. I’m also currently unemployed and looking for work.

In the past I’ve smoked weed and it’s helped with the symptoms even before I was officially diagnosed. A couple months ago a good friend of mine gave me a few CBD gummies to try and they worked perfectly to stop the tremors and help me get a good night’s rest.

I’ve just purchased a CBD vape and some oils so that I can manage my symptoms myself since there’s really not much else I can take for any of it because of my age.

Even months later I still find myself thinking, why?

I had plans and now because of this most of them fell through. Not really sure why I typed this all out. Just wanted to I guess. Thanks for reading if you do.",2019-01-01 05:29:22

My sleep is fucked and I've been spending a lot of time by myself - which is good *and* bad. 

While I've been off, I've had the chance to do more research and I'm realizing how devastating this disease can be: how it affects your mood, your ability to support yourself, and how it impacts your family. 

Also saw Love and Other Drugs last night. Did you know that Anne Hathaway's character has YOPD! I could relate to so much of that movie! (Minus the hot sex with the attractive Jake Gyllenhal.) 

Anyways, I've been non-stop crying these past few days. I could really use some support somehow. I don't know what it looks like, but thought I would put it out there. Whatever you can say will be greatly appreciated. Seeing some orange notifications will help this broken brain...

I work in as a nurse in neuro rehab, and have noted that he has had some tremors for close to 10 years. Over the last 5 years, he has increasingly dramatic thrashing with dreams at night. Most recently, I note that he holds his arms at his side wile walking. 

I a terrified, and have no idea of how to bring this up to him without scaring him. He's not at the point where I think he neds meds yet, as I know delaying that is better. 

Any thoughts on how to gently suggest that he see a PD neurologist? I know who he needs to see via our insurance, but he will FREAK out. Things are too subtle for his PCP to see in a 20 minute visit once every couple of years.

Perhaps this belongs better in /r/relationships, but I'd like some feedback.

Update: I had my DAT scan last Thursday. The results came.back as ""mildly abnormal"" and I've been referred to a neurologist. Does anyone have any experience with those kind of results? I'm relieved it showed something, but at the same time worried about what happens next.

I'm a 32 year old woman and have been having depression, insomnia, pain, tremors, forgetting words, misspeaking, hallucinations, and rigidity.

I've been falling over more and feeling horribly exhausted. I have 3 kids and work full time teaching middle school. I had abdominal pain and bowel issues at 19, finally was diagnosed with endometriosis at 23 and had a full hystorectomy at 29. I thought my pain would be more manageable but it is getting worse.

November 2017 I decided to take a leave of absence from teaching for the spring and summer. I found a less stressful school and am still struggling to do simple things. I lost and got health insurance so I have a doctor's appt in January.

My father passed away in March 2018 and we went to his memorial put of state. Cleaning up his house I found his military paper work and my uncle's. My uncle and dad were exposed to Agent Orange while in Vietnam. My uncle's medical records stated he had Parkinson's. No one had ever mentioned it. His kids and I remembering him shaking and were told by other adults that's what happens when you do heavy drugs and go through withdrawal and get clean.

He died at 47 and I don't know if it was substance abuse like the family says or Parkinsons. 

I'm just feeling bad tonight. Sore. I have to wait for my appointment to get a neurological referral and my family/husband think I'm worrying for nothing and I am fine. I don't have a diagnosis, but I do not know what else could be wrong with me. It seems so far away to have to wait.",2018-12-14 14:59:45

I was wondering if anyone who was medicated for Parkinson’s, has tried CBD for tremor relief or even for other symptoms related?


I recently bought my Nana some CBD Gummies (30mg each) but she just started taking them 2 days ago. We are not sure if it’s doing anything yet, I believe she may need a higher dose (I told her to only take one because I didn’t want negative effects to discourage her) but from my friend whose taken CBD for chronic muscle pain warned that taking too much may cause headaches? I’ve not read that anywhere but I was wondering what an appropriate dose would be if anyone here uses it? 
I’ll of course do more research on dosages before I recommend anything to her, because I would never want anything bad to happen to her. But would love to hear opinions/recommendations of people who are using it specifically for Parkinson’s. So that I can take multiple points of view into consideration. 


Also before anyone tells me to talk to a medical professional first- we, of course, have spoken to one and they said it would fine with the medications she takes (epitol, amantadine, carb/levo), no harmful drug interactions would occur. They also said they heard good things about CBD though there isn’t much research on its effects with Parkinson’s. They also warned that it may make her drowsy as her normal medications already do and the cbd would just be extra, on top of them. So they said she shouldn’t drive on them all and should take cbd separately from her medications. 


So let me know what everyone thinks and what pros and cons you’ve all run into and what dosing was like for your journeys! 

Thank you

My mom was diagnosed with PD about 5 years ago. She is about to retire, and my dad still works. She is very, very smart and I think the loss of her work is devastating, although she'd never admit it. She goes to voice, physical and normal therapy, does PD yoga, exercises, and drinks Boost to supplement her diet. She can't take antidepressants. Her voice gives out often, her tremors are so bad she can't do basic tasks, and she's lost a huge amount of weight.

My mom has always been the rock of the family, and she has always been very independent and forward-thinking. But I think she feels like she's hit a wall, and it's hard for her to find evidence to the contrary when she can't physically do anything. My dad gets frustrated with problems he can't solve. I know they need me around, but I can't leave school yet. I've organized my schedule and saved up so that I can visit more often.

I can't ignore the problem, but at the same time I can't diagnose it with any precision. ""Being there"" doesn't seem like it's enough. Calling a family meeting to talk about what she needs seems like it would be almost cruel. Suggesting she take up a hobby would get me laughed out the door, not that anyone's really laughing. I don't have the perspective I need on this, because for most of my life, she's been ""Mom"" rather than a person with struggles and dimension. I should have been paying attention much earlier, and now I'm unprepared. How do I talk to her about what she needs? 

Apologies for the long post and vague question. Thank you for reading.",2018-11-30 00:28:01

I am not seeking a diagnosis I am merely trying to gather my thoughts on the situation I am going through.

&#x200B;

I am 33 years old and for the past year I have struggled with the suspicion that I may have YOPD. I suspect my symptoms may go back even as far as 6 years, this is when my son was born, and also when I started getting extremely unnatural fatigue. I initially thought that the fatigue was just a given due to being a new father but over the years this fatigue has never went away and its something I constantly have to struggle with. No matter how much sleep I get the night before by the end of the day (and many times during the day) my fatigue will hit and no amount of coffee or water splashing to the face can keep me from feeling completely and utterly tired. For example, today I had a wave of fatigue hit me. I started work at 430am, last night I had a solid 7 hours of sleep, and by 6am I could barely keep my eyes open, after an hour it went away but it can come and go seemingly at any time. As the years went on I developed a new sleep related problem, nearly every night I will wake up with an extreme adrenaline rush. It usually happens the same time every night around 1-2am. I have had no problems with insomnia.

&#x200B;

My next set of problems began with my right hand a year ago. The very first sign I figured something might be wrong was when I attempted to move a heavy piece of furniture a long distance. My hand completely locked up and after I put the furniture down, I could not willfully open my fingers. This was an isolated incident that I have not seen again so maybe that is unrelated but I have had some pain and stiffness in my legs and feet. From there I began having a mild twitching in my pinky that would come and go then it stopped for 6 months and has now returned 5 days ago in my index finger but it went from a mild twitching to a visible movement that also seems to come and go. Yesterday I had a very bizarre episode where I was having sporadic twitching in my finger, at one point in the day I had to urinate badly but wasn't in a place to do so, and the twitching in my index finger began but remained most of the day at a near constant and now today its hasn't occurred at all.

&#x200B;

The other two symptoms I have is constipation and something completely unlike me at all, anxiety and depression. The constipation, like the twitching, seem to come and go. I can pass a stool but it is very difficult to do so and is mostly unproductive then some days I might have a perfectly normal bowel movement. The depression and anxiety arrived a year ago with the twitching, and just like the fatigue has not gone away. I have always been an optimistic person even possibly too optimistic at times, I am also usually a very happy person regardless of any crummy situations I might be in, but this anxiety and depression has no purpose in my life and it has come to a point where I am having intrusive suicidal thoughts for no reason at all. Let me note that I am not suicidal, nor do I have the urge to do so, I am quite the chicken, but it is indeed very scary for me to be in this place.

&#x200B;

In wrapping up I just want to add that the coming and going of symptoms is so very confusing for me, It instills many doubts in my head due to their sporadic or wave-like nature and its also the reason I haven't seen a doctor yet since I can't exactly just replicate visible symptoms to them. If you made it this far, thank you! your an awesome person, any insight, comparisons, or advice/ comments would be much appreciated.",2018-11-20 03:19:30

IMy father (67, Indian male)  was diagnosed as having Parkinsonian symptoms about a month ago. At that time he had slowness in his gait and shuffling feet. However he didn't have the characteristic hand tremor and was very alert and active -- he was taking and completing online college courses.  The doctor first prescribed a half tablet of  125mg Sinemet three times a day and after about a week added Premipexole .25mg twice a day. Within a couple of days of taking Premipexole and about a couple weeks after starting Sinemet, my dad started having regular hallucinations all the time. He sees people wandering about our home and small children sitting on his bed. He talks loudly both during sleep and waking hours. His voice slurs to the point of being indecipherable. His cognitive functioning has reduced tremendously to the point that he is unable to carry on a conversation. He had been undergoing physiotherapy and had seemed to be making significant progress but that has reversed dramatically over the last few days.  My physician said that the drugs would take a few months to start taking effect and that the dosage shouldn't be reduced. I'm not really sure what to make of this. I'm hoping someone else would have some experience dealing with this.

If you tend to have trouble opening, closing, turning things, pressing buttons, or achieving the motions needed to open traditional locks and doors, what would make it easier?

Is pressing a button easier than turning a dial?

Is it easier for you to grab a handle to open a door, or easier to pinch and pull a small knob?

My Dad was originally diagnosed with PD at 50 when I was 14 years old. The diagnosis was changed to a spinal cord injury as a lesion on his spinal cord showed up on a CT scan. During my senior year (this past spring) he took a Datscan and the results came back as PD. Since then I have been struggling to cope. My Dad is a physician and has always been the one to take care of those whom are sick. He is the kindest, most loving, and giving person I have ever met and it’s just not fair. The roles had changed and I think that’s what is hardest for him is playing the role of the patient. He was devastated when the results came back as being a doctor he has had many patients with PD and knows the progression of the disease. When he was 50 he had to switch to writing with his left hand. He still works Monday-Friday 8-6 in the clinic and at the hospital. After his diagnosis he took a short break but returned to work. I think work is the only thing that keeps his mind off of it. He is very active (works out most days) and has a very good sleep schedule. His tremor in his right hand is bad enough to the point where he has had to switch to his left for all motor skills (eating, writing, typing). His spasms are bad and he has dystonia as well. Now that he is on meds he seems to be doing slightly better. I know that I can’t change things and can only do my best to be there for him but I’m terrified. I don’t know what to do because he has always been such a strong motivated person who never complains but I know he has to be breaking on the inside. I know this is hard for my mother as she is right there seeing the progression of his disease. I am 19 and in my Freshman year of college now at the in college studying biomedical engineering. I want to channel all my spite, anger, and self-pity into something positive and hopefully be one of the people who comes up with things that at least improve the quality of life for people like my father and so many others that suffer from Parkinson’s or other neurodegenerative diseases. Does anybody have any advice for how to cope with this or what I can do to help him? I live close to home and see him often. The other weekend I went home and we worked out twice over the weekend. I know it could be worse but I worry the most about psychological effects in the future. My grandma had terrible dementia and lived with my family for 6 years before she died and I fear that my Dad will end up like this too. I have seen dementia at its worst and worry about where my Dad will be in 20 years. How can I help support him and continue to stay strong and take care of myself?

I am 47 and was diagnosed with early onset 3  years ago. It started in 2014 with a stiff right forearm but has slowly moved to my hand. My arm felt inflated or pressurized and I thought it was a back problem. Then my lower right leg - below the knee-  started to feel stiff. My gate is off and my arm swing is somewhat limited. My writing isn’t great but it’s OK the hardest thing to do is type. But otherwise I feel generally fine. If my symptoms are progressing it is very slowly. I feel like I got to the point where I am now and things that remain are basically the same.  My wife may disagree. I went mountain biking this past weekend and my balance and ability are fine. 
I am taking levodopa and I recently stopped taking Ropinerole.  I sometimes wonder if my cognition is off but I have always had a terrible memory. 
I have been dealing with depression most of my life and used to smoke a LOT of weed to self medicate - took years to figure this out. I wonder if I hurt my brain doing so. I am on Lexapro which has helped a lot and I rarely smoke. When I do smoke I feel like my right arm and right leg are worse which is why I wonder if there is a connection or is it just because I’m stoned. 
Between the back and weird affect when I smoke i wonder if there are other things affecting my body. 
I should add that I’ve been dealing with 20 years of a herniated disc that has always affected my right leg and still does. I feel there is some connection between the two Problems as well. 
People talk about being scared about the future with PD but for some reason I am blank when I think about it. maybe it’s just being depressed.
I am not denying that I may have it and if I do I can accept it but it just doesn’t all make sense.  Not sure what I am asking just looking for a little bit of advice. Thanks for reading.  Stay strong ",2018-10-24 19:59:52

My maternal grandmother was officially diagnosed this year, and she has had symptoms as long as I can remember (head shaking and shuffling gait). To this point, I have attributed most of my symptoms to mental illness or hormone imbalance, but this past spring *I* started having head tremors, too. The spells would last up to 30 minutes at least, and trying to stop the shaking caused pain. I also had tremors in one or both arms last winter, but these I attributed to a religious experience (hasn't happened in months). I also learned this summer that I have a gluten intolerance (once after eating gluten I experience another shaking spell). Most of the tremors are controlled by the bupropion I'm taking for my depression and anxiety. However, my TSH levels are high and I've experience unusual weight gain this year. In the past two months I've also developed seborrheic dermatitis and short-term memory issues that are negatively affecting my daily life (I'm \~25f, and I'm working on a Ph.D, so you can see how the memory thing would be a huge issue). 

I plan to see a neurologist soon, but there's a huge part of me that's trying to convince myself it's nothing. As I'm speaking my left hand has a very small, almost undetectable tremor, but I'm wondering if it's psychosomatic because I'm thinking and reading about the possibility of YOPD.

Are psychosomatic tremors a thing? Or am I just trying to convince myself it's all in my head? I'd love to hear from anyone else with experience detecting YOPD, especially if the tremors aren't the most noticeable symptom.

I am reaching out to the community to see what I can do to help. I understand this is a degenerative disease, and there is only so much one can do to slow the onslaught. I've read through all the posts here, and am trying to evolve a strategy where I can help him through his years.

I would be grateful if others can provide some answers to questions I yet have. Please post any links to websites that you found useful.

 \-- Is the disease mainly physical? I see depression and mood changes being mentioned too

\-- What can caregivers do to give the patient succour? What gives them happiness and relief? I understand this is subjective....but Do patients have mental faculties intact? How about their senses? Would reading to them give them pleasure? Would they still retain sight? Speech? 

\--Would they require physical assistance? My dad lives with my mom and things will be hard for her. Would they require nursing assistance?

He is 57 years old, and he works real hard at a desk job (draftsman) and always has done. As a result of this he has always been overweight whilst I have known him.

I was wondering if there was anything he can do to help him at this point? I know there is no cure. He has to hold down his right arm now because it's always shaking (he's taught himself to be left-handed over the years since he found out).

Is there any particular fitness/Physiotherapy sort of exercises that have helped people? 

Would being overweight and sedentary make his symptoms worse? 

Should he think about lessening his work load? He works from 7am until 6pm 5 days a week. He lives in London for work and commutes home to my mother and siblings about a 4/5 hour trip for weekends, and always has done. I know stress makes the symptoms worse and I was wondering if I should think about saving some money so he can stop working sooner.

Should I try to see more of him whilst he is still okay? I know the answer is probably yet but I'm just at a bit of a loss at the moment.

Is there anything that I can do to help him? Or any advice I can give him?

He is one of those guys that wont seek out help on his own.

Because I live away from home I don't get to see him that often, I love him so much and just want to do something, anything. I just need some advice about what is to come.

i seem to have always had small problems with memory and such but lately it’s been worse and paired with general confusion. As well as that iv had problems with the left side of my body.
Pain in my limbs more so on the left as well as shaking hands. 

My lips shake and my head sometimes does this weird nodding/shaking no movement. I also have freezing gait and when I sit I slightly sway from side to side. 

I also seem to be experience some on/off periods. Some part of the day I could be fine with very good movement and the next minute I could be frozen in place in pain with slow movements.

My body gets easily tired from movement. Like clenching my fists I can’t do very well at all. As well as when I need to pick something small up, my hand shakes uncontrollably, making picking the item up embarrassing and impossible. 

I am also researching what I can do to get disabled parking. However I’m not sure if my condition is eligible for it in Australia. 

I will be going to my GP to get me referred to a neurologist but id like advice from people that have PD or know someone with it.

I am going to email you, and probably 5 more institutes to make an attempt to have someone hear my theory. I understand that the odds of me being the one to fix this issue, not fix but improve function is 1 and well infinity, the variables are unmeasured due to outsource factors that are 1 in a infinity.   Parkinson is a neurodegenerate diseases in which the substantia nigra has a genetic mutation associated neuromelanin, neuromelanin controls the filtration aspect of toxic metals such as iron. A person with this genetic mutation is more likely to develop neurological issues such as Parkinson based on age, and the rate of the decay of the substantia nigra neuromelanin. The food they eat strongly dicates how much iron is applied to body, the mutation dictates how much filtration is applied. Due to Mr Micheal j fox, muhammond ali, etc, genetic background negatively effects how well his or her brain filters iron. in order to not solve the issue, that can be done with gene therapy but in order to suppress one much lower the content of iron in their diet.  The mutation is a factor of blue eyed European decent humans. Fun fact, muhammond ali's grandfather was irish. you are post 1 of 5. ",2018-10-18 10:52:15
966,Should I go get checked to see if I have PD?,CrazedBassist,2,9p4g8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parkinsons/comments/9p4g8r/should_i_go_get_checked_to_see_if_i_have_pd/,7,1539852985.0,"So I am 23, and all my grandparents on my mom's side had Parkinson's, My uncle(22) Just got diagnosed with early onset Parkinson's last year, and my mom just went in for testing to see if she has it(shes 39 her tremor is less than mine in intensity). I have had a tremor since I was about 13 and some days its barely noticeable and other days something as simple as plugging my phone into a charger is difficult. After she went in this week I began looking up symptoms and discovered  I have a lot of the warning signs, stiffness in the shoulders, Insomnia, Depression, Anxiety, sweating(not often excessively more often randomly like outside in 40F degree weather then suddenly sweating like its in the 80s), Cognitive Issues(more so in articulation my fiancee pointed this out recently said its almost like mid sentence it gets harder for me to remember the right words), Lower Libido(this one more recently I've always been impartial to sex but now its almost like a complete non-need for it), constipation this symptom appeared about a year after the tremors first appeared and have become a daily reality(using the restroom could be an hour long endeavor for me if I have to take a shit), Pain(mostly in my wrists and lower legs always just assumed it was carpal tunnel in the wrists never had an answer for the legs pain) and Lastly Tingling in limbs(occasionally I'll be sitting or walking and my legs will just go all pins and needles or my right arm normally during bad days will do the same). 

&#x200B;

Enough with symptoms because that could just be a case of googling and freaking myself out. Lets Talk my main issues; My right hand has the tremor the worst and it gets worse if I try to speed up my movement going from controllable to I literally have to sit and mentally slow myself down. My legs also have a small tremor in them but that seems more anxiety related if I become enraged, scared, or panicked I can't move, I will shake so bad taking a step will throw me to the ground(often literally normally during these episodes I have to sit down until I get my heart rate and emotions under control). I only recently found out about Parkinson's in my family(like 2 days ago) although my parents have insisted I go get tested since I was 17(17 was when the tremor actually surpassed my mom's I shake twice as bad as she does, My uncle is about on the same level as mine as far as how bad the tremor itself is). None of these symptoms have worsened since and the tremor itself has become more manageable(but as I said there are bad days, I cannot be sure it becoming manageable is it getting lessened or just me getting more and more use to compensating for it). I was told when I was younger it was some sort of benign tremor(forget the exact word) but at that time the doctor did ask if I had a family history of Parkinsons and neither me nor my dad knew its rampant on my mom's side(all my grandparents were dead by the time my tremor started, and my dad never had any contact with them, they hated him while my mom and him were together when they split they had even less reason to be in contact with my dad). With my mom going into testing at the urgin of her doctor she contacted me because my tremor is worse than hers and let me know I should probably get tested as well(IDK the reason her doctor suddenly suggested she get tested me and my mom don't talk talk a lot, she moved out of state and I don't see her but once a year). Now more often then not its just a consistent tremor, noticeable enough that I have become sick and tired of answering ""why are you shaking?"" or ""are you on something?"" or best response to it yet(this was on a bad day from some old lady who came into my old job) ""Are you going through withdrawals?""(I kept dropping change on the ground while trying to count it back to her)

&#x200B;

I have seen a doctor(not since I was 18 I'm to broke for that since I moved out of my parents) back in highschool about some of the issues but had them each separately addressed(Leg pain was probably lack of potassium, tremor was benign, Libido was just because I was out of shape(not exactly athletic but I work out 3 times a week and am down to 176 at 6foot 1 with 18%body fat so I would say I am in decent shape), Stiffness I should see a chiropractor about(never did), Sweating well he had no answer for that, wrist pain was likely due to me having broke it 6months beforehand etc. 

&#x200B;

So now for my question is it probable? Should I go see a doctor about these issues not as separate issues but address the doc with my concerns that each of these could be symptoms of PD and inform him of my family history? What are my next steps from this point, other than seeing a doctor? 

&#x200B;

I would like to state I'm not really worried since my uncle was diagnosed I kinda always had the suspicion so I've already come to terms with that, more so I'm worried about money if I do get diagnosed I know treatment and medication are expensive as fuck and I can barely keep the lights on(I would like to say my tremor has destroyed several job opportunities either because employers didn't want to get sued if I have a bad day and get hurt or they didn't want me breaking things. The best excuses I was given is they felt I lied about having a disability or thought I was on drugs). ",2018-10-18 09:56:25

My Father was diagnosed with PD 2 years ago but the medication hasn't helped at all and seems to make him worse, the diagnosis was reached using a clinical checklist very quickly and the DAT scans were too blurry to be used.  He is taking Sinimet tablets and Resagiline patches at the moment but in the last 2 months his arms and hands have become a real problem and he is saying he is struggling with chewing and swallowing. 

Everything I have read online suggests the medication should be helping but his symptoms are progressing rapidly.  We have an appointment with his consultant this week but I don't know what to ask, has anyone had any similar experiences with such rapid progression and can anyone suggest what I can ask the consultant? 

Update:  Apologies for the delay, my Father's consultant has admitted him for inpatient treatment so they can focus on getting his medication right and help with his mental health.

I'm relieved he is finally getting the help he needs and I hope this is the step forward he needs to improve, it's been really hard the last couple of months seeing him decline so rapidly.

He has, however, only had a handful of good nights of sleep in the last few years. He's tried melatonin and a few prescriptions for sleep, to no avail - if he wakes up in the middle of the night needing to pee, he has a panic attack because he can't move on the meds. He has a lot of trouble getting comfortable to sleep. As a result, even the idea of a lift chair is questionable, as he can't seem to get comfortable on his back to sleep. . . At all.

I have a few risk increasing genes in my DNA (ancestry dna test, analyzed raw dump using promethease).

Looks like green tea, regular high intensity workouts, managing weight, and staying away from direct exposure to herbicides/pesticides might (might!) help reduce chances of getting PD. Going to have regular neurological exams (yearly? I'm 35M). 

Anyone know of any studies where they track symptoms, reflexes, brain scans, whatever? Would like to participate and have my issues tracked if they end up developing.

I specifically asked her if this is the parkinson disease? She said no, it's parkinson syndrome and that she looked at the brain scans.

It was a brief speak, and I didn't manage to get more information out of her, will talk more in couple of days.

But is there really any difference between two? They have her brain scans and all, and they started giving her levadopa/carbidopa already. If this is not parkinson, why are they giving her levadopa? It's no different then?

Also, can I postpone taking levadopa medication for some time? My mom can function absolutely normal, hands, legs and other body parts are not affected, it's the head tremor which is the problem so far. I wouldn't want her to start taking levadopa right away if she functions normal, as I heard after years of levadopa it developes into dyskinesia and it's 10 times worse than any parkinson, if levadopa doesn't cure, and only leads to dyskinesia, what's the less evil? having dyskinesia or parkinson symptoms?

I live in one of the poorest countries in the world, and the healthcare here is pretty bad, it's nothing close compared to medicine in developed first world countries.

I just wanted to say that my father was diagnosed at the age of 45 when I was about 11-12 and has had the disease for over 15+ years. I basically have no recollection of a time when my father didn't have PD. Over the years, I've learned so much including compassion, empathy, regret, responsibility, accountability, courage, strength, and much more. He is my biggest hero. 

As a Canadian and today being Canadian thanksgiving, I am so very thankful for everything in my life, including support groups like this. If you have PD and you're currently having a bad day, I urge you to never give up, no matter how hard things may/will get. You never know who you're inspiring. My father has inspired me to be a better person, treat others better, start an annual fundraiser, work at a biotech company trying to find cures for cancer, create a business that donates to PD, all of this he is only barely aware of.

1003,Could these be early parkinsons signs?,ash763,1,9j32f0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parkinsons/comments/9j32f0/could_these_be_early_parkinsons_signs/,6,1538001521.0,"First I just want to say that my grandmother had parkinsons, and as far as I know, no one else in my family has it. I have autoimmune issues, including psoriasis that I managed to put into remission through the AIP diet, and other autoimmune problems that are undiagnosed (at this point im guessing fibromyalgia and or arthritis). When I eating this diet most weird and uncomfortable symptoms go away, but it's a very strict diet and hard to stick to. Also I am 24, F.  


Symptoms:

* Lately I have felt like my tongue was receding to the back, without my control. I thought I was just imagining things and panicking, so I consciously relaxed my tongue and it went away. But it has happened a lot of times since. Most notably tonight when I had a small amount of chardonnay. Every time I took quite a few sips, this would happen.   

* My hand sometimes slightly shakes. Never really thought much of it until lately, along with other symptoms, and the fact that it happens more when I'm eating inflammatory foods.  

* I get this feeling in my face muscles, as if I have been laughing a lot. I also get this feeling in my legs. For no reason.  

* Muscle twitches/spasms in random body parts. Lately my eyelid, my lower right tummy, and my thigh.  

* Sometimes I feel like my muscles are thinking of doing something different, like there's a slight delay. Only a fraction of a second, but i can feel it. Like they have a mind of their own and are just thinking about it, not acting on it.  

* Along with the tongue and face thing, sometimes it feels like my jaw is a bit locked. It's only just enough for me to notice. Enough to think I was imagining things if it weren't for the other symptoms.

So if anyone here has parkinsons, what do you think of this? Do you think it could be parkinsons, or something else? If you think it could be parkinsons, what should I do? What tests should I get? Who should I see?",2018-09-26 23:38:41

In the end she just quit moving and became unresponsive. She had Hospice care and so I believe she was not in pain and was clean and as physically comfortable as possible. I sat with her the last two days. Then she just quit breathing. There were no spasms or crying out as her heart simply stopped. I am thankful the end came so peacefully for her. I post this because everyone here is facing the eventuality of their own death or the death of a loved one. Just wanted to let you know it could be gentle. Thanks to this community for past support.

Since his diagnosis, he has been progressively becoming inflexible in his movements (eg. He can't really reach his back anymore to straighten his t shirt when he's dressing himself) and its almost like his muscles are losing mobility and strength. 

At the same time, its almost like he's becoming more and more reliant on others to help him with simple tasks...sometimes, even tasks that he seems to be perfectly capable of doing, albeit with slightly more effort. I don't want to treat him like someone who isn't capable of doing things himself as I feel like the more he relies on others, the more he's just slouching into the progression of his Parkinson's.

My gp has had left arm tremors only during movement. He has had MRI's, a DAT scan, 2 CAT scans they just say they think it is Parkinson's. I don't think it is. He has been to 2 neurologists. I have read about the disease and know that not every person has all of the symptoms. A ur ago his gate changed and his left arm stopped swinging. He started stumbling, again only thing that shakes is his left arm. Within 5 months he can no longer walk. Leans over to his right side while sitting. His left arm hurts he says and it only shakes when it's unsupported. His voice tone has changed over the past 2 months as well his speech at times is slower. They just put him on a Parkinson's medication a few weeks ago but he has just gotten worse. He is sleeping a lot. Does this sound like the right diagnosis? 

Update: Thursday he couldn't get up and my son couldn't help either. My mom finally called for an ambulance. After two days at the hospital they have moved him to a physical therapy center. The latest mri they state does show Parkinson's. They said they changed his dopa meds. What the nurse said makes sense and I can't believe I never even thought about it. She asked when it all started and as I said this has been a very fast decline. But going back to his arm getting weak and those types of symptoms was a few years ago. Yes the walking just started because I bought him a hurricane for last Christmas due to him being unstable on his feet. Now he cry's on commercials granted they are touching but for someone I have never seen cry it is very sad. He is also starting to stare at times before responding. Thanks for giving me the info on the previous post. I think we are just glad we finally have the diagnosis not sure why it matters.",2018-09-16 06:57:45

We're under the impression it's REM sleep disorder at this point.  His doctors threw klonopin at the problem (over the phone, but I digress), which did solve the problem for the ~week he was on it, but he had a noticeable increase in number of falls so he ceased taking it.  He was also noticeably less sharp and less ""with it"" mentally throughout the day, despite only taking it at night before sleep, so I'm happy to see him off of it from a quality of life standpoint.  

I haven't slept through a night since he stopped taking it, and I work for a living.  I sleep the next room over, and I'm weighing the pros and cons of wearing ear plugs to sleep, but my main concern is I won't wake up for a bad fall.  Are there alternatives to clonazepam/klonopin that anyone has experience with for this?  

Ironically, he has a hard time speaking with enough volume to be audible throughout the day, but he has no problem cranking that volume up to full on screaming in his sleep.  I suppose it's one way to do those voice exercises...   ",2018-09-12 19:26:33

My team is also doing research on our own but we wanted to ask the community as well. Thank you so much!

After looking at a bunch of research, I truely believe science is close to significantly halting progression, if not outright curing Parkinson's disease. 
I believe this halting, and outright cure of PD will come in two different areas.

1. Eliminating gut dysbiosis by establishing a good microbiome via fecal transplant: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/Parkinsons/comments/9dnvi0/tremendous_link_between_neurological_disorders/

2. Stem cells directly injected into the substantia nigra to repair or outright regrow the damaged dopamine producing neurons in that region of the brain:
https://www.cureparkinsons.org.uk/News/stem-cell-treatment-for-parkinsons

There is an upcomming trial regarding fecal transplants to restore gut microbiome:
https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03026231?cond=microbiota+transplantation+parkinson&rank=1

Stem cells have shown to work in animal models but are there any current human clinical trials involving stem cells and humans? 
Yes
Some are already occurring and are scheduled to be finished in 2019. 2019 looks to be a big year for results:

Here are the clinical trials regarding stem cells and Parkinson's:

One trial is enrolling by invitation and is scheduled to be end of 2018 (this year): https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03128450

This trial is scheduled to be finished in July 2019: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02184546

They did a skin biopsy and that came back normal, no neuropathy.  I've had an EMG, MRI, and a bunch of blood work.  My symptoms are tightness in hands, tightness in shoulders; twitching and shakiness (it's more like I feel shaky rather than am shaking; I also feel this weird internal vibration when lying down).  I have really bad sleeping.  I can't seem to sleep more than 4 hours at a time.  And maybe 6 hours total per night.  I don't seem to have super vivid dreams anymore, but I'm not sure.  I'm beginning to have issues walking.  What I'm noticing is that walking is very sluggish, like my legs weigh more.  Going up and down stairs is labored.  No weakness, as I was able to play tennis and basketball yesterday.  And no clinical weakness found by neuros.  I also have this weird sensation before falling asleep, though not every night, and not sure if they're hypnagogic jerks, but it feels like I'm being electrically shocked, followed by my arms going numb or curling under me.  Very scary feeling.  Usually feels like the bed is falling out from under me as well.  I also seem to get little cramps just from walking up a few stairs.  Pains in fingers and toes now too.  I also have a slower digestion system than before, more gas, bowels delayed.

I guess I thought it was PD because of the non-motor symptoms --- the sleep, GI symptoms --- but I'm wondering, if not PD, then what?  I'm not hoping it's PD, but no one has told me what it \*could\* be nor what other doctors I should pursue.

Any clues?  Should I specifically see a movement disorder specialist?  My neuro said he didn't think I needed to.  And he's sort of the gatekeeper for whether or not I should.  All I know is, I haven't felt like myself in 6 months.  Is that too early for more definitive symptoms to appear anyhow?  Can't seem to even get comfortable for more than a few minutes.

big name neurologist  at Menninger clinic.

I say this because my wife had parky long before  she was diagnosed ..... you  will  find in most cases your loved one will display little signs of parky many months or years before ms develops full blown
parky.

Believe me  I know this disease process  back ward and forward  ...
and I wish to God that were not true ... but it is in fact 100% true.

There is  way to much to say in this posting about parky.

1.  go to  and   read and absorb the michaeljfox website  i think you can find it.

2. do not trust most drs with care of your loved one ....   they don't know and they don't care to know.

3.  your loved  one  must take a properly adjusted dose of 2 types of carbaleva drugs  an : xl  50-200mg  bid  and   IR  25 100mg  qid is the recommended dose .... be damn fucking careful how you dose these drugs .... caution applies here.

4. there are probably more than 20 well recognized drugs showing efficacy agaist parky .... but take the wrong drugs and go psychotic ....

 that's right psychotic if you use the wrong medicine .... do you really think i would put this in   print  and risk my reputation if i was not sure i am correct ????


...  i am a professional working with all kinds of diseases much of my life 
...i do not scare easily .... i am  scared of some of the experimental drugs in parky 


..  i say don't experiment.  that's  all i am going to say .... just do not experiment.

5. parky is a terminal disease!   that means parky will kill you   IF some  other disease does not kill you first.   HERES THE SECRET T0 HE MEDICAL COMMUNITY DOES NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ..... THERES ANOTHER  DISEASE WILL KILL YOU BEFORE PARKY .... BUT  WHY ? I AM ABOUT TO TELL YOU WHY .... PARKY AND PARKY TREATMENT CAUSES OTHER DISEASES TO IN 
CUBATE  WITHIN YOUR BODY ....

 you will
die of one of these other diseases that is caused by parky   and  most parky drugs are very toxic... they cause disease .... do not argue with
me .... just wait and you personally will see i am correct.... remember  this posting !!!

6 i use no notes when i write 
... i write from memory .... i live this 24 7 i remember everything about parky so    might as  well AMA  about parky ... oh and yes i do have the pro credentials  to  understand parky ... at one time  very   long   ago  i taught human neuoranatomy (not very good credential  but  OMG  apparently enough) ! 

11 02 18 Update.

Parky wife has lost ability to stand or
walk on here own.

Wife is placed in nursing facility.

Wife knows  she will never walk again and is pensive toward life.

End of life is apparent to parky wife and to me ...parky husband.

There  is absolutely no way to prepare for end of life issues.

Endings always come to fast and they  pass   to   slow ... that's
All I know    that's  all I know ...  (ArtGarfunkel 1973).




God help me !

GOOD LUCK.

I've learned a lot over the years about this disease, and just wanted to share the things that I wish we would've known from the beginning.  

1. If you don't like your doctor, keep looking. He didn't like his first doctor, yet stayed with him for 6 years. That doctor did little to nothing in terms of educating us about the disease or the progression. 

2. Be your own advocate, or select someone you trust to come along to all appointments to advocate for you. Come prepared with questions to ask the doctor. 

3. Do your own research. Read about it. Go to seminars. Check out support groups for PD. Knowledge is the best weapon in the fight against Parkinson's. 

4. Exercise! Exercise! Exercise! Yes, we all should be doing it, but it is so important in delaying the disease. My grandfather didn't start with the exercise until after he broke his hip, which made it exponentially more difficult, and he never recovered. 

5. Have the hard conversations with your loved ones about what your wishes are. We're in the midst of having to make the decision to move my grandfather into a nursing home for his safety. It would be so much easier if we would've addressed this before he reached the point of no longer being mentally ""with it."" 

My heart goes out to all of the people who are fighting this disease. I've seen how debilitating it can become firsthand, and I will never stop advocating and educating on behalf of the Parkinson's community. ",2018-09-07 09:50:46
1040,Tremendous link between neurological disorders and intestinal microbiota dysbiosis via the “gut brain axis” that occurs in Parkinson's Disease patients,BluePhoenix81,8,9dnvi0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parkinsons/comments/9dnvi0/tremendous_link_between_neurological_disorders/,8,1536301736.0,"A fairly long read/post but worth it if you want to be encouraged about the recent developments/research regarding Parkinson's disease.

Parkinson’s disease and other neurological diseases link to dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota (gut bacteria).

The following few articles and excerpts of research show a tremendous link between neurological disorders and intestinal microbiota via the “gut brain axis” and the dysbiosis that occurs in PD patients. “Dysbiosis” is a term for a microbial imbalance or maladaptation on or inside the body. 

Once this Dysbiosis is corrected, some amazing things happened (read studies below)

Excerpts from a 2016 Pub Med.gov US National Library of Medicine Nation Institutes of Health article:
Titled: “Gut Microbiota Regulate Motor Deficits and Neuroinflammation in a Model of Parkinson's Disease.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27912057

“The intestinal microbiota influence neurodevelopment, modulate behavior, and contribute to neurological disorders. Using mice that overexpress αSyn, we report herein that gut microbiota are required for motor deficits, microglia activation, and αSyn pathology. Antibiotic treatment ameliorates, while microbial re-colonization promotes, pathophysiology in adult animals, suggesting that postnatal signaling between the gut and the brain modulates disease. Indeed, oral administration of specific microbial metabolites to germ-free mice promotes neuroinflammation and motor symptoms. Remarkably, colonization of αSyn-overexpressing mice with microbiota from PD-affected patients enhances physical impairments compared to microbiota transplants from healthy human donors. These findings reveal that gut bacteria regulate movement disorders in mice and suggest that alterations in the human microbiome represent a risk factor for PD.”

Excerpts from a 2018 Pub Med.gov US National Library of Medicine Nation Institutes of Health article:Titled: “Dysbiosis of gut microbiota and microbial metabolites in Parkinson's Disease.”
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29705121

“Gut microbial dysbiosis and alteration of microbial metabolites in Parkinson's disease (PD) have been increasingly reported. Dysbiosis in the composition and abundance of gut microbiota can affect both the enteric nervous system and the central nervous system (CNS), indicating the existence of a microbiota-gut-brain axis and thereby causing CNS diseases. Disturbance of the microbiota-gut-brain axis has been linked to specific microbial products that are related to gut inflammation and neuroinflammation. Future directions should therefore focus on the exploration of specific gut microbes or microbial metabolites that contribute to the development of PD. Microbiota-targeted interventions, such as antibiotics, probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation, have been shown to favorably affect host health.”

Ok, so there is a strong link between neurological disorders and intestinal microbiota via the “gut brain axis”. What happens in animal (mice models) when fecal transplants happen from healthy people to PD mice?

Excerpts from a 2018 Pub Med.gov US National Library of Medicine Nation Institutes of Health article:
Titled: “Neuroprotective effects of fecal microbiota transplantation on MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease mice: Gut microbiota, glial reaction and TLR4/TNF-α signaling pathway.”
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29471030

“Parkinson's disease (PD) patients display alterations in gut microbiota composition. Remarkably, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) reduced gut microbial dysbiosis, decreased fecal SCFAs, alleviated physical impairment, and increased striatal DA and 5-HT content of PD mice. Further, FMT reduced the activation of microglia and astrocytes in the substantia nigra, and reduced expression of TLR4/TNF-α signaling pathway components in gut and brain. Our study demonstrates that gut microbial dysbiosis is involved in PD pathogenesis, and FMT can protect PD mice by suppressing neuroinflammation and reducing TLR4/TNF-α signaling.”

OK, so a fecal transplant “reduced gut microbial dysbiosis, decreased fecal SCFAs, alleviated physical impairment, and increased striatal DA and 5-HT content of PD mice.” 

With all this promising information, It looks like there was a recent study started fecal microbiota transplantation in subjects with Parkinson's Disease (PD) that started in January 2017:
https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03026231

Unfortunately, as of August 2018, the recruitment status says “withdrawn (study will be started under a new modified protocol)”

The questions then are:

1.	What does “new modified protocol” mean?

2.	When will the new study start?

Some things to think about:

3.	With all the promising info we know about a tremendous link between neurological disorders and intestinal microbiota dysbiosis via the “gut brain axis” and the dysbiosis that occurs in PD patients, why aren’t more clinical trials being done/started regarding fecal transplants and PD?

a.	https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=microbiota+transplantation+parkinson&term=&cntry=&state=&city=&dist=

b.	I was thinking about writing “The University of Texas Health Science center"" (the sponsor of the the clinical trial) but have not yet. Does anyone have any more information on this?

4. The government/FDA is currently very restrictive on what regulated fecal transplants are approved for and the disease doctors can treat. Currently, its only approved for C. Difficile

5.    When can the public get safe regulated/monitored/quality controlled (not youtube do it yourself versions) fecal transplants other then for C. Difficile? 

a. An example of ""safe/regulated/monitored/quality controlled is the company ""Open Biome"" that monitors, inspects and keeps tabs on quality of fecal transplant material. 

6. Should more be done by us to push the government to get more ""off label use"" of regulated fecal transplants considering fecal transplants have already been done safetly for the last 50 years and it has a 1700 year history:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4977816/ 

After reviewing a bunch of research it appears that there is a tremendous link between neurological disorders and intestinal microbiota via the “gut brain axis” and the dysbiosis that occurs in PD patients. This is a very promising field of research regarding PD and other brain or body diseases such as Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, metabolic, autoimmune diseases, autism, multiple sclerosis, chronic fatigue syndrome depression, anxiety and irritable bowel syndrome.

Hopefully we can push the right entities to start clinical trials of fecal transplants and PD and for opening up the restrictions on ""off label use"" of fecal transplants currently in place by the FDA/government.

I've been experiencing a range of symptoms which I'm worried may be YOPD. I've been to the doctors before, 3 times. They chalked it down to anxiety and didn't take me seriously but I'm not so sure. For the record I'm 23, M. I know it's very hard to say just by reading the below but I would really appreciate your thoughts.

My symptoms started off around 3 or 4 years ago when I started experiencing Bruxism. I went to a couple of dentists and they didn't really have any good advice on how to deal with it. I wasn't even sure if I was imagining it at first as I would be half asleep/half awake and feel as if my teeth were about to snap off from the pressure of clenching. 
Anyway, fast forward about till about a year and a half ago I started experiencing aching sensations in my limbs whenever I got a bad sleep, this still happens but isn't as severe as when It first started. 

The next symptom which appeared is my lower jaw constantly chattering if i bring my teeth together and soon after that i noticed if I completely relax it, it sometimes moves around left to right and in circles. It's worth noting i can hold my jaw in place to stop the movement which adds to the tension in my jaw even more (making my Bruxism worse i think). Lastly I noticed a tremor in my hands, if i let my hand go completely dead then it's fine but as soon as a outstretch my fingers they start tremoring, the worst are my pinky and ring finger. 

This happens on both hands but my left (non-domoninate hand is worse). These tremoring symptoms have persisted since the beginning of this year, there has been no period where they are completely gone. When I do exercise my hands tremor worse.

Lately I have also been experiencing internal tremors in my jaw, in my torso and down my left side (not left leg but foot and ankle) and right arm. 

My sleep is troubled, I have extremely vivid dreams on many occassions which are usually nightmares. There have been times when I'm either falling asleep or waking, in the hypnagogic state where I'm conscious enough to note my finger(s) moving, like a slow tremor but way more range of motion than the ones i experience while awake. Upon writing this I can also recall upon waking up that my left ankle rotation is definitely cogwheel like but disapates back to normal once I'm fully woke. 

Also possibly unrelated but I can think of two times where I have experienced tinnitus so loud that it pulled me out into a semi conscious state while asleep, it was actually painful like someone was blasting a horn straight into my ear canal, both in the past 4 months.

I also have been experiencing gut issues which swing between diarrhoea and constipation, I've never had any issues with constipation before in my life. This has gone on for at least 4-5 months. Diet has remained fairly consistent.

I can say that i have no reduced arm swing or stiffness of movement besides the foot above and havent noticed an impact in any area of my life in terms of movement capabilities. I can still play the piano no issues. Sometimes when I'm on the computer i feel as if my typing and mouse hand isn't as accurate but it's subtle so I can't rightly determine between placebo or actuality. I have't noticed any sorts of big changes with my hand writing but I generally don't do a lot of it so again, hard to tell from my perspective.

I have 0 family history of PD, MS or ET. I hoped and prayed that these symptoms would leave me and it seems sometimes they do improve only for another one to flare up which pulls me right back down into the pits of my anxiety and dread.

Since he was a child, he dreamt of having his own boat and began to save money at 17 to finally buy his own sailing boat when he retired. One year later, he was diagnosed but that didn't stop him from spending half of the year each year on his boat. He loves to sail solo, mainly in the Mediterranean sea, and to sail in high sea. He's a really good sailor (have been sailing most of his life) but recently his state got worse: it became really difficult for him to climb the narrow stairs, to move fast on the boat or to just walk around. 

He's getting hurt more and more, mainly scratches but he also broke his Achilles tendon 2 years ago after falling on the deck. Right now his other leg is really swelled because he fell one month ago but he's also really stubborn and decided that everything was fine so he didn't want to go to the doctor.  He also changed his medicine 2 month ago and that made him phase out sometimes, and really sleepy and less coordinated. He has friends who came to sail with him and all of them told us (my mom and my sisters) that his state was  really concerning and that he definitely shouldn't sail alone. He keeps on recruiting novice crew members to sail with him from time to time and doesn't want to listen to us when we urge him not to do that (his health is his concern, but other people's lives are involved here). 

Me, my sisters and my mom live in the north of France, so we really can't check on him as often as we would want to, and once again he's really stubborn and doesn't want anybody to tell him what to do. I know he's the happiest when he's on his boat, and his only thoughts when he's on land during winter are for spring, when he will finally be able to be on his boat again, but I'm at the same time extremely worried about him. 

I'm slowly accepting the idea that sailing on his boat is the best thing that can happen to him right now and that he should enjoy it while he can, and I'm pretty sure he knows the risks and  has accepted them. It doesn't make it easier for me though, because I'm always wondering if today will be the day we'll receive a distress signal from his boat, or if today is the last day I'll hear from my dad. I also come back from one year abroad and I saw him again today and his physical appearance shocked me. It saddens me to see him getting angry and frustrated at things he can't do anymore, because he's a really curious person, he loves to travel and he even learned Italian after he retired because he fell in love with this country. Today I asked him if he was able to practice during the past months but he told me his voice his going away so he can't communicate properly anymore. 

There, I've spend one year not really thinking about it (or at least less) but today it struck me again.

This probably isn’t the high quality content you come to r/Parkinsons for, but we’re looking for a bit of a hand in getting this film made.


The film revolves around a young, classical pianist who is diagnosed with Young Onset Parkinson’s Disease and the Punk band that changes his life.


The film is being made in association with Young Parkinson’s Ireland, and 20% of all the funds raised via our gofundme are being donated to charity - as are any profits made by the film. So far we have raised half of the funds needed to complete the film, but are still €2,500 short of our goal.


The film was made on a zero-budget with everyone involved giving their time and skill for free. If any of you could contribute that would be awesome, even the smallest donation helps and 20% goes straight to charity.


Even liking our Facebook page via the link below, following us on twitter: @thenewmusic, or watching/liking our teaser trailer below helps us immensely.


Thanks for your time.


Rock on,

In the course of a few days, he went from being a totally normal person with some difficulty walking to an absolute crazy person who has no idea who he is and what's going on around him.

He has had Parkinson's that was progressing slowly for about 2 years. When he started medication, it all went downhill and now there doesn't seem to be a way to go back, since the medication causes dependence.

After weeks of begging doctors, he was finally brought to the hospital to the neurology, but soon ended up being transferred and locked up in the psychiatric ward due to psychotic behavior. Now he's not allowed to leave (not that he could in this condition). Ever since he got to the hospital, his condition has gotten much worse. You know those films where there's an over-the-top stereotypical crazy guy? It's like that. No contact with reality and no way to communicate with him. Seeing things, hearing voices, being strongly convinced of things that aren't true.

His doctor had no clue what's going on, suspects that it's due to the medication but now that he's dependent on the medication, it can't be stopped.

His prescribed medication is:

* Yumex (the instructions say that it should be taken separately from Madopar but doctors administer it together with Madopar for some reason)   

* PK-Merz (no longer taking it due to it making psychosis even worse)   

* Madopar (4 halves a day causes severe psychosis but it's not enough to allow him to move, now taking 3 halves a day, still quite a lot of psychosis and not able to move much)   


Stopping medication now makes him *completely* unable to move, as in unable to swallow or even lift his hands or move his head. However, stopping medication also stops his psychosis. Starting medication again will again start psychosis and slightly improve his movement (he can maybe stand up with a lot of effort, but will fall over).

This is in a country with only social healthcare, so there is no private option. You are assigned to a doctor and you don't get to choose no matter how rich you are.

I don't know what there is to do. Any advice? Is this just how Parkinson's goes? I've heard of deep brain stimulation surgery, does that help with psychosis?

The only thing that worries me is that this is not due to Parkinson's, but rather the side effect of the medication. So if it weren't for the medication, he would just be a normal person who needs a walking cane to get around. Now he's a psychotic mess locked up in a psychiatric ward.",2018-08-18 05:58:55

Up until last November, she’s accepted it and lived as best as she could, depending on how he disease was manifesting. 

In November, she fell and broke her back for the second time. For a while, she tried to get better. Then she just accepted spending her life largely immobile. 

As time passed, she became less interested in doing anything at all. 

This weekend, she was rushed to the hospital because she refuses to eat, drink, or take her medicine. The doctors diagnosed her with a failure to thrive, saying that the only thing between her and health is her choices. They sent her home on hospice, saying that she’s probably not going to make it the week if she doesn’t make the choice to continue living. 

Has anyone dealt with this before? Has anyone experienced someone coming back from this or is it really the end? Is there anything we can do to help? I’m not really keen on the idea of just waiting for her to starve to death or become so dehydrated that she dies. ",2018-08-14 13:56:23

After recent news of the actor Alan Alda’s diagnosis with Parkinson’s Disease, my mom realized that he might have PD, too. Last year, he started walking slowly (PD gait?) and had trouble using his right hand. No resting tremors, only when he tries to bend the fingers on his hand does it tremble. But we thought his slow gait was because of a foot injury/surgery he had due to an incident during one of his Army tours in the Middle East and to arthritis, which his doctor recently told him he has. He also has a compressed spine with herniated discs (?) due to years of wearing heavy packs as an airborne/paratrooper and has been having vivid dreams where he will drool excessively and act out by talking and moving in his sleep. He was diagnosed with PTSD several years ago and is a disabled vet. His body has definitely taken a beating over the years due to the Army. 

Thank goodness he will have great retirement income when he retires. His current job doesn’t require him to do much either so he is able to wind down during these last few months before retirement. My dad has had problems dealing with stress for his entire life and I’m sure it’s one of the causes of PD if that is what he has. I never thought my dad would suffer like this so early. You think being so healthy and active, it would never happen to you. But mental health is so important too and he has never considered managing his own mental health and stress. He’s been through a lot and I’m scared for him. I know he is depressed right now and will turn to alcohol as a way to cope. Maybe this diagnosis will help him quit drinking once and for all. 

He has an appointment in two weeks to confirm whether or not he has PD and it seems very certain he has it. I am so sad and worried and researching about PD over the internet. We know it’s not a terminal illness and he can still live a long healthy life. But he is an excessive drinker to the point where it’s probably safe to call him an alcoholic. Will this make PD worse? I read online that it varies between patients. I also read that if caught early and treated, it can slow progression. If signs were present only last year, is it still considered early to help? I want him to get counseling and physical therapy immediately, like right now. ",2018-08-14 01:47:52

I have this problem that occurs only ok my right side, either in arm/hand or leg. Where basically the muscle will subtly and slowly tense up. Like over the course of 10-15 seconds. Then it’s like hey this muscle is quite tense, I should relax it. I focus on relaxing it and it works for a few seconds, but once I stop focusing on it it starts back up. It usually alternates between arm and leg. If I stay focused on one part, the tension movies to the other part. 

Its worse at night, and moving it can help, so I thought it’s restless legs, but I’ve not seen anyone describe RLS like this. I have no itching, burning, or desire to move the limb. 

Does this sound like what anyone else experienced early on?, I’ve sleep very poorly. I have sleep apnea, but use CPAP but it didn’t help that much. And last night was the worst, I got practically no sleep because of the tensing. I have slouchy posture too.

as much as I can, I even take her to the pool to exercise most days. There she can walk a bit. But it's not easy, she is extremely rigid and overweight, barely can move or talk to the point she has to wink to say yes/no when she can't user her finger to point at letters, and when she does she is frequently jumping topics, which makes it hard and frustrating to keep track of what she means. 

About a week ago we went to see her doctor, and the issue of swallowing came up, along with the possibility in the near future of needing a stomach tube. I am with her a lot, and I knew she wasn't going to be a fan of it. I know she is in pain from the tightness she gets in her hands, her neck, her back, and even with botox she hasn't gotten relief. So I asked her about euthanasia, and she said she did wanted to do it.

I am mad at the world right now. I am mad at myself for not being able to help her. I am mad at her for not being better. I am mad at being alive and having to see her like this and not be able to do anything about it. I want to die, but I can't because it would just make her more miserable than she already, and that would be so cruel to her. She is a good person. Not perfect, but she doesn't deserve it. I wish there was a god so I beat the living shit out of him for this. Fuck this disease. Fuck me for not being able to handle it better. I'm just feeling tired and trapped. I can't go away, I can't help. I'm living with my parents and working with my dad so I can be at home to help, because even though she has two helpers that rotate and come in the day, if they stay with her she just sits and watches TV. It's not that they are bad, my mom is just heavyweight and rigid, so they can't handle her much outside of sitting her and taking her to the bathroom. We are not rich, as a matter of fact, my dad works his ass off and then has to at nigh put up with her and me, and I don't know how he does it. I would have blown my brains out ten times over if it had been me to have to do what he does. He is a better person than I could ever be. But in the end it doesn't matter. We could be living in a gold house, and have all the money in the world, and she would still be miserable. This is like a black hole. Throw as much shit as you want in it, it will never fill. And I feel like I'm falling inside. I am a shit son, shit help, shit everything. Ever since this thing about the euthanasia came up I have been having problems with sleep. I've been trying not to drink but since I can't sleep I just get hammered at night and play video games until fatigue beats me. I know her only way out is dying. Everything is going to keep getting worse until she dies. And I don't want her to suffer. But it hurts like hell knowing she wants to die. That everything amounted to nothing. I'm not against the idea of euthanasia, but I can't bring myself to look it up for her. I am a coward, for not trying to help her and let her continue like this out of my personal issue with this, instead of helping her. 

It's insane how even though she can't move, that fucking paralysis in other ways still spreads. Fuck this shit life so much. And this is only how I feel. There is just no way to understand how miserable she must be.",2018-08-01 05:02:41

I’ve been having a twitch in my left pinky and ring fingers.  They twitch inward towards my palm.  I also have benign fasciculations.  Had an EMG in June—normal.  Also an MRI a few months back— unremarkable.  I do know that, for example, if I lay on my back and hold on my leg at about 45 degrees, my leg will start tremoring.  Same if I squat down or even hold my phone at a weird angle— my shoulders and arms begin to shake.  I’ve had some gastrointestinal issues, mostly slowed motility and horrid gas.  I also have insomnia and muscle jerks when trying to fall asleep.  My dreams are insanely vivid and I can only sleep for about 3 hours at a time.  I don’t have restless leg syndrome as I had a sleep study and it was ok except for REM (my big issue is I never feel tired, not remotely). 

I also have tinnitus in my left ear, sore joints, burning in various parts of body (which I take Gabapentin for, and seems to help), as well as on and off issues swallowing (ie comes and goes).  

The fasciculations were in my arms and legs and even ears!  But have oddly quieted down the past week.  But this pinky and index finger twitch, along with the jerks while trying to fall asleep, are new.

Obviously I have anxiety but did anyone else’s experience begin this way?  I know everyone’s different but my doctor also suspects I have autoimmune since I have positive ANA (inflammation) and even read Celiacs can cause neurological issues!

He was recently put on anti-PD medication and the side effects are worse than the PD itself. On the first day he had total urine retention and could not urinate at all, so was given a catheter.

And now, a few weeks later, he suddenly started exhibiting serious psychotic symptoms, including auditory and visual hallucinations, no track of reality and time, and paranoid delusions. He believes that everyone is against him, that there are ants on the walls, and hearing voices, believing his long-dead dog is still around, etc... He lives alone and can't even keep track of taking his own medication. He also fell over and hit his head *hard* on the floor (pool of blood).

This is all due to the side effects and him not being able to keep track of the correct dosage. He has no clue of what he took/needs to take, maybe he's taking too much or not enough, no one knows. Sometimes he can't even move, with entire body rigidness.

We called an ambulance but they said they can't treat him, beyond giving him basic emergency treatment which won't help with the psychotic symptoms. His head is fine now physically but his psychotic symptoms are getting worse. We called his doctor but he's on vacation and said ""he can't help"" and that we shouldn't bother him while he's on vacation. We called a bunch of other places but no one can help, no one gives a shit, they have no clue.

Anyway, while we figure out how to get him into a hospital, we need a short-term emergency solution.

I know that stopping medication is dangerous. But continuing the medication is even more dangerous. What is the correct course of action in a case like this?

Sorry for asking for medical advice but when no doctor, hospital or ambulance can help, I have to turn to the internet or he will be dead very soon.

***

**Update:**

His medications are **Madopar** (4 halves a day), **Jumex** and **PK-MERZ**. We've figured out through trial and error that PK-MERZ is the main culprit, and we stopped giving it to him. He has improved a lot immediately, with psychosis going away completely and movement improving. However, every time he is given Madopar, psychosis returns for a while, but doesn't stay indefinitely. It seems that Madopar acts very fast and the sudden influx of dopamine causes psychosis. Jumex seems to multiply the effect of Madopar and therefore shouldn't be given at the same time.",2018-07-27 20:15:08

Hi all, I'm a clinical research coordinator with the University of Rochester. The UR Department of Computer Science is developing a new tool in collaboration with the department of Neurology to help individuals with Parkinson's disease and their care providers monitor symptoms of PD. We are currently in need of participants (with and without PD) to try out the tool and provide feedback.   


The study involves you opening the tool in **Google Chrome**, agreeing to the E-consent form, and turning on your computer's webcam and microphone. The tool will then lead you through a series of recorded tasks. These tasks range from reading a short sentence to tapping your fingers together in view of the camera. Altogether, participation should take about 15 minutes. After the tasks are complete, you will be asked to fill out a short demographic survey including your email address, where we will send a $50 Amazon gift card within a week as compensation for your time and effort. To access the study and read more about the University of Rochester’s research into Parkinson’s disease, please go to [this link](https://machinteraction.com/parkinsons).

He had right arm tremors for a few years and started really having cognitive deficit over the last year or so before we could convince him to finally see a doctor. It has been a nightmare since he started treatment. His tremor has gotten a little better. His general confused has gotten worse, but probably at a progressive pace. He has been incredibly dizzy since he started treatment and has suffered multiple syncopal episodes, and many, many episodes of near syncope. His vertigo has been debilitating. Despite his symptoms before treatment he was for the most part independent, but now he is afraid to drive much and can barely leave the house for fear of passing out. We have discussed this with his neurologist, who says he needs the dopamine, the pills he takes for the dopamine can cause dizziness and blood pressure drop that can cause him to pass out. My father in law is on the brink of giving up the meds. I fear that may have severe consequences sooner rather than later, but I am also sympathetic to the fact that his quality of life is basically non-existent at this point. I work in healthcare (MRI technologist) but really don’t know a lot about this disease. I feel like his neurologist may not be helping him and wonder if we should find another.

I'm a longtime redditor but want to re-introduce myself. This isn't a promotional post at all; my main goal is to ensure that people have a direct line of contact.

Two weeks ago now I started a new position at Tobii Dynavox as Global Product Manager for Augmentative/Alternative Communication (AAC) Symbol Software, which roughly equates to everything pediatric, although I have a lot of experience and involvement with the eye tracking hardware and other products as well. Prior to this I've been an SLP in the schools and in private practice as well as an AAC developer with Avaz and others; I also do a podcast on AAC called Talking With Tech (and founded a thing called SpeechScience that used to get posted here quite a bit, which I merged into another organization when considering this job). Without going into too much detail, suffice to say that the community around speech generating devices is very personal to me. I passionately believe that communication is a human right and that ""complicated bodies hold clever minds."" While obviously only a percentage of those with Parkinsons end up using AAC, I still wanted to put myself out here as a resource.

I want to extend an invitation to please consider me as a point of contact in the future for any needs you might have. I will try to pay attention to the various forums, and certainly I can be responsive about AAC questions generally here on reddit (whether or not they're relevant to T/D products), but I'm sure I'll miss things so feel free to message or email me at lucas.steuber@tobiidynavox.com. If I don't know the answer I should at least be able to find it for you, and I want to make sure I'm aware of any obstacles, successes, as well as feedback as to how we can make solutions better in the future. I have a very distinct set of priorities entering into this position and engaging with, supporting, and overall being accessible to the community is probably the most important. Your thoughts and concerns WILL be heard, and I'd love to listen to ideas individually or build some long-term relationships for ongoing feedback.

So! Consider me at your service, and any questions are welcome in regard to Tobii Dynavox stuff, AAC, or whatever else generally.",2018-07-17 13:06:27

Just 4 years ago he was unable to bathe or feed himself, could hardly speak anymore, and was completely disabled.

Since 2014, under medical supervision, he's been on a very specific amino acid protocol.

The physiological changes are nothing short of miraculous.

He just traveled on a plane to visit us - by himself - for the first time in years.  He's now taken up drums, and we were even able to jam together on guitars during his visit.  The day after he returned home last week he called me while out on a bike ride.

I am a lifelong sufferer of depression and anxiety and was diagnosed with work-related PTSD earlier this year.  Next month I'll begin a much decreased amino acid protocol than Michael's and am certain, given Michael's results, that I'm going to experience radical relief.

This episode is worth listening to for anyone dealing with Parkinson's or other neurological issues (depression, anxiety, PTSD).  [Here's the link](http://www.gregandjennifer.com/234).

Since a month my dad (62) has been in the hospital as a preparation for an operation. 
In the first week there he got a little tube in his nose which ""feeds"" him the medicine. Which meant he could let one of the meds he used go. When he did he went into withdrawal which is normal because he quit cold turkey. 

Now to get to the point:
In that first week he developed a fear for getting into his hospital bed. This was due to the withdrawal and also him being unable to move his limbs or body in general. The anxienty  came from when he got some sort of lucid dream which he described as falling through quicksand and only being able to hold onto an edge (which was the coathanger looking thing that is above most hospital beds). From then on he has had a lot of mental trouble when getting in to the bed and had flashbacks when waking up during the night. This has lead to him sleeping on the floor in his room a lot. (luckily he has his own room)

I wonder if anyone has had a similar experience themselves or a family member. Also any advice dealing with the issue is welcome. The hospital workers don't seem very understanding.

1141,Dad finally came home after having DBS removed,mamastrawb,34,8wyihj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parkinsons/comments/8wyihj/dad_finally_came_home_after_having_dbs_removed/,7,1531046732.0,"I posted on here about 5 months ago, when my father had his DBS removed. He had fallen and gotten a bad scrape on his scalp, which then got infected, and eventually exposed the wires connecting the units, so all of it had to come out. My father was diagnosed ~30 years ago, and had his DBS for 17 years. We were told this happens sometimes, but it wasn't until later we found out how unprecedented this all really was. Yes, sometimes a DBS has to be removed due to infection, but it's usually right after surgery, when the initial wound becomes infected. To remove a DBS that's been in place for 17 years was absolutely unheard of. Nurses and aides kept asking us ""is he usually--"" and we kept having to tell them this is totally uncharted territory. There is no normal right now. 

It's been a nightmare. The first few months my father was barely conscious, only sometimes able to nod or squeeze our hands in response to questions. He was in and out of ICU for various infections, kidney, liver, gallbladder...He was eventually moved to an acute care facility, then to a rehab, and now finally home.

Through all this, they have been constantly adjusting his levels of Sinamet, which he has never done well on, to try and achieve some level of awareness. My dad is getting better and better, and finally seems to recognize us when we are with him, asks questions, responds to things we tell him, but he is still extremely foggy/drowsy. 

Physically, he is getting stronger and stronger. All his physical/occupational therapists have remarked about his incredible drive to improve, and we're optimistic he will be able to stand on his own within a few weeks. As of now, he can sit up in a chair for most of the day, and feed himself. 

His neurology team said if he was a new patient, getting his DBS would be out of the question. But because they took it away, and because he did so well on it for so long, they feel they owe it to him to give it back. We have been warned that he may not improve, in fact it may cause his neurological symptoms to worsen. 

We were originally quoted 6 weeks before his DBS could go back in. It has now been 5 months, and it's looking to be 1-2 more before his next surgery will be scheduled. My family, especially my incredibly devoted mother, has put our lives on hold while we ride this out with him. My father is the strongest man I know, and I just hope he gets his life back eventually. I bought us annual passes to the zoo for Christmas. I still hope we get to use them before the year is out. 

I don't know why I felt the need to post this update. Just to vent, I suppose. To connect with a community of people touched by this disease. To know that there are others who have endured this, too. Thanks for reading, if you made it this far. ",2018-07-08 11:45:32

Anyone had luck with getting a neurologist in the Boston area to prescribe this? My dad is considering changing his doctor anyway.

Edit: to be clear, we are not considering a med without a doctor. Many medications are prescribed off-label by doctors for many diseases. It’s expensive for the drug company to get approved for a new indication, so they often don’t bother. However if the med is out on the marketplace and proven safe for one indication, say diabetes, and there is evidence it is useful for another, say Parkinson’s, some doctors are willing to try it with a patient who is interested.

We've seen major decline in his cognitive and physical functions in the last18 months. He has never had really bad tremors, but he displays the other classic PD signs - Shuffling while walking, bent over posture, minimal facial expressions, tiny hand writing etc. We are most worried about his executive functioning, it has tanked completely in the last little while and he has maybe 2-3 ""good"" hours in a day. He is recovering from spinal stenosis surgery and we've moved him from his home to an assisted living facility (which he can only afford for maybe 8 more years). He's on the standard PD meds 6 times a day (he's undergone no other treatments). His house has just sold and he lives across the country from us so we manage everything from a distance. We don't want to take him away from his girlfriend, friends and local support system until he needs full time care and is bedridden. From doing reading it looks like he's in stage 3 - 4 of the disease: needs someone to administer meds and meals at the right times, is currently using a walker to get around (the spinal stenosis attributed to this), we don't see freezing gait yet, he's not hallucinating due to PD (we don't think, although he did hallucinate while on percocet after spine surgery), he's not able to plan ahead or stay organized, short term memory is awful, we have taken over paying his bills and managing finances which he's been ok with .... he's not bed ridden and can still move around on his own, although that is limited, he has some trouble sleeping at night and definitely can't seem to stay awake for most of the afternoon (daytime narcolepsy).

My questions are:

\- What can we expect to see in the next 5 years? 

\- What will the end of his life look like? I know every person experiences PD differently but I am anxious to know what to expect. Nobody seems to want to talk about this but knowing what to expect will help me plan for it, as shitty as that sounds.

\- Will he eventually lose his mind similar to an Alzheimer's patient? Or will he be totally lucid but bedridden/frozen?

\- When is the right time to move him to a nursing home? We are Canadian so if any Canadians are reading this it might help me understand this process from a government funding perspective as well.

1165,What to do when a parent won't seek medical attention?,frukthjalte,1,8trwlc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parkinsons/comments/8trwlc/what_to_do_when_a_parent_wont_seek_medical/,2,1529972994.0,"In my opinion, there are two ways to approach  potentially dangerous situations: You either worry about the worst possible outcome (which is what I tend to do), or you deny the threat altogether (which is what my Dad is doing).  


While constant worry sure drains a lot of energy, at least it gets things done at the end of the day. Since I worry excessively, the things I get done usually turn out to be not that bad. My headache wasn't a brain tumour; my bruises wasn't due to cancer; my stomach ache turned out to be period cramps and not appendicitis.   
Because I tend to go straight to the worst scenario, I've had to teach myself how to think more rationally. So I usually tell myself that it's just my anxiety playing tricks on me (which isn't always a smart move either, but that's besides the point). 

Now here's the thing: my Dad is a 64 year old man who still hides behind denial like a child trying to get out of trouble.   
It started maybe two or three years ago with slight tremors in his right hand and fingers. He told me this was because he had ripped off a muscle in his shoulder ten years prior. Yeah, whatever. Maybe that was true, maybe it wasn't.  
But the tremors kept getting worse. And worse. And worse, yet. Whereas it started off like when you hit your funny bone, resulting in tingling; it's now at the point where I can hear he's reading the newspaper from across the apartment due to the severity of his hand shaking against the pages.  


It's also worth mentioning that about 15 years ago, he fell and broke his foot.  He was left with a slight limp due to a lack of proper rehabilitation. This limp gets worse when he's been walking around a lot. On the other hand, I had foot surgery in 2010 and I can walk just fine without pain. So when his limp got worse, he explained this away, too; it was because of the surgery one and a half decade ago. 

But everything just keeps getting worse and worse. On top of his walking and his tremors, he's also lost a lot of weight, it's getting harder and harder for him to get up from the couch at the first attempt, and just yesterday he casually mentioned, after drinking a glass of water, how lately it's like the water goes down the trachea instead of the esophagus.  


I mean, if this was something that didn't get increasingly worse over several years, I wouldn't be bothered, and I'd attribute the sinking feeling in my stomach to my own anxiousness. But I do think the evidence pretty clearly points to him probably struggling with Parkinson's. At one time I remember my ex even asked him about his hand, and he kind of brushed it off and said ""The doctors are talking about Parkinson's(!), but that's only because they won't listen to me"", referring to the doctors ""not listening"" to his babbling about his surgery and ripped-off muscle in the shoulder.  


I just don't know what to do. I feel like I can't even look at his arm because he'll notice I'm worried and he'll know that I'm thinking about Parkinson's -- which he probably is too, somewhere deep down -- and it'll make him feel bad. I also can't confront him straight up because he's stubborn and will refuse to listen; there's even a risk he'll avoid medical attention even more if I talk to him about it. I have a chronic disability myself since birth and while I sure denied things when I was a kid, I've since realised that doing so won't change the fact that it is there; all it does is making it potentially worse because you're skipping on medication or other forms of treatment. 

I just... Ugh. It's so hard watching someone who's always been my best friend slowly melt away like that. Everybody  we know agree with me that it's something very wrong, potentially PD, and yet no one talks to him and if they do, he kind of shuts out their comments. Help.",2018-06-26 01:29:54

It's been 3 weeks since potential diagnosis and she's began taking a modest amount of Levodopa, .5 tablet 3x daily, for two weeks to start and has increased the dosage to .5 tablet 2x daily, followed by one whole tablet 1x daily. 

We are seeing minor positive effects. Her tremors, while still apparent, are better, she's more comfortable all-around, able to sit more comfortably for longer periods of time. We feel hopeful at this.

What hasn't changed is her gait. She walks with a lot of slack on one side of her body and also has a lot of trouble with her balance. She'll spontaneously begin to stumble backward or sideways as though the floor has suddenly tilted. She's fallen on the ground twice.

I'm concerned about this the most. Is this a common symptom of Parkinson's? Does anyone have experience with treating this? Will the medication work better and better over time? She'll be increasing her dosage again in a week to 1 whole tablet 2x daily, followed by .5 1x daily. 

I guess I'm just wondering what to expect. These symptoms have been present and misdiagnosed for about 3 years and it had become debilitating. We are relieved to have an answer, but aren't sure what this means for her mobility and independence in the future. 

Will she bounce back, or is the damage done? Is it different for everyone? Does anyone have experience or advice to share, or really anything to offer? Thanks for reading.",2018-06-23 08:59:46

A bit ago I posted trying to find an answer for a easier way for my grandmother to let us know when she needed help, so we looked and looked and found a set of wireless door bells from Amazon for $30, 2 battery push buttons and 3 speakers that plug into the sockets.              

We were looking for a cheap alternative for my grandmother with Parkinson's disease to alert us when she's fallen in the other room or at night when we are sleeping. She doesn't like using the Life alert due to the drama it causes just to get us up so she'll lay there.                          So to give her a sense of Independence we decide to try this route. We have a rather large house and my bedroom is downstairs at the other end of the house. The signal reaches ALL the way down there perfectly. We are able to have one in both of our bedrooms and one in the kitchen if she's in her bedroom. There's even a siren sound we've chosen. Lots of sound options and each remote can be programmed. So we placed one on her walker leg and then made a necklace out of the other. So far we haven't HAD to use it but for the cost it's amazing. Maybe it'll help someone else as well!

My father was diagnosed with PD at age 60 and he’s been living with it for 8 years.  There’s been a noticeable and steady decline in his mental acuity since then, although I feel like the decline began before his diagnosis.  Right now, I’m worried about his ability to manage money.  

My mother has started taking over the day to day bills but she’s still in denial of his disability.  There’s also the complication of his assets including money in the bank in China.  And because he is the “American”,  some of his family in China have asked him for loans. I’m concerned that he will be taken advantage of and my mother will just look on and blame him (as she does now).  They have marital issues and it’s rife with mistrust regarding money.  It’s hard to get them to talk about financial issues or to reveal to each other their finances.  They are married so it means my mom has some control over certain assets but she doesn’t have control over his money or individual retirement funds.  

Recently, I convinced my father to let me help him handle his financial affairs since my mother was reluctant to and he wasn’t keen on letting my mother get a hold of “his” money.  

However, I have found he makes rash and poor decisions without consulting me (due to his dementia I believe).  He was visiting family in China and made a sudden trip to Australia for two weeks without telling anyone.  He almost plunked down $2k for some “acupuncture” treatment by a quack who said she can “cure” his PD.  He loaned $15k to a nephew in China without question who was overextended already and now struggles to pay the money back.  

To make matters worse, any interference I make he gets angry and suspicious about.  Again, I think that’s his dementia talking.  But I’m starting to think I need to take over his finances.  I feel like I’m the only who seems to be looking out for his interests.  My husband is an MD and has sent me resources for families of dementia patients.  I’m a bit overwhelmed by how much work this will be.  I am trying to care for someone who lacks the insight to understand his condition and has accused me of being heartless at times (I’ve had to take his keys away, I won’t let him handle a kitchen knife due to his fall risk etc).  

Does anyone have experience with how to take over the finances of a dementia patient?  I don’t want to be giving him pocket money but I would like to have a say (or arrange it so my mom has a say) in any large financial transactions.  

TDLR: Father with PD is showing signs of poor financial decision making and I feel I’m the only one that cares about it.  How can I prevent him from making poor decisions and protect him from those that would take advantage of him? ",2018-06-08 00:23:11

He’s being pretty proactive and signed up for a boxing class for PD. I was wondering if anyone has any insight into safety regarding amino acid supplements in tandem with his levodopa. I already knew a lot about amino acid balancing when supplementing when I took 5-HTP for depression. I know that serotonin precursors and sulfur amino acids get depleted by dopamine precursors thus exacerbating treatment side effects. I know you guys aren’t medical professionals or anything, but I’m just curious about any possible thing I can do. I’m such a worrier and I’m not about to let my dad suffer on my watch! :) Thanks for your support here.",2018-06-01 15:10:59

He has been showing signs of dementia for a few years (lost his sense of smell, confusion, forgets everything). He has been making extremely reckless decisions in the last year (hanging out with a 34 year old drug addict woman who has been abusing him emotionally and most likely physically. She has robbed him and stole from him and he will tell me and my siblings these things and then he will defend her to no end. She overdosed in his house and has lost her kids).

He has a tremor in his right hand when it's rests. His posture looks just like the picture from Wikipedia. The only reason he went to the doctor was because he fell twice in a day. He is super fragile and has extreme depression and apathy. He lost his business and house last year and lives with my aunt. I dont think he is capable of working or taking care of himself. I am terrified for him. 

He will most likely not go to the neurologist unless me and my siblings literally make the appointment and take him. His behaviour for the last year has alienated everyone around him. This woman abuses him everyday and it's obvious to everyone else but his brain....I dunno. He knows he's making super stupid decision s and doesn't seem to be able to stop. He knows he is sick but he will not address it. 

I am relieved that we finally gave answer for his behavior in the last year but I also know it's gonna be a challenge for my whole family and it will most likely take years to get everything together.

I don't even know why I posted. I need support and people who might have experienced this. This woman. Had destroyed my father but his brain is not well and I'm afraid Parkinson's and dementia have rendered him incompetent. I just want to help my father but I know I will bit be able to do that with her in the picture. I have spoke to lawyers and they said it's almost impossible to get courts involved. 

I need my father to seek help and accept this. I need support as this is stretching me way too thin. I have no one to talk to about this. My siblings are married and have others for emotional support. I do not have many people irl to speak to and the ones I do seem to be super busy or dont have a full grasp of the seriousness of this. I'm terrified. I know my father's terrified. I don't know what to do. I don't want to get a phone call saying my father is missing or a call from my father saying he doesn't know where he is in his own neighborhood. He didn't even recognize my sister at his father's funeral.

It doesn't matter if the ball goes in or not. Then, the device pops the ball back up to the person (see terrible drawing). This takes away the need for the person to bend over and pick the ball up. I will openly admit my ignorance towards Parkinson's disease as none of my family and friends have been impacted by it. I would like to know if a device similar to this would be helpful in any way to people with Parkinson's. Could they use it to practice/train? Do devices like this already exist? Any input would be greatly appreciated.

He's been diagnosed at a very young age for the disease (54) and has recently turned 63. He does not have the tremors like you see in some cases, which was a good thing I thought at first. Apparently the type of Parkinsons he has is a worse one.

Over the past couple months things have been going downhill drastically, he will freeze in place, usually fall, and won't be able to move for sometimes hours. He is not able to use his phone during that time usually and it just breaks my heart (and my moms even more) every time I see him lying on the ground.

The thing I am looking for is a simple button that sends a message or a call to either my phone or my moms phone, because I feel he would be able to do that still.

I did look around on google, but wasn't able to find what I was looking for, maybe any of you have an idea, or maybe another solution.

So next month our team of 4 men from the UK will row 3600 miles across the Indian Ocean in aid of Parkinson's Disease, it will take around 65 days unsupported. 2 hours on, 2 hours off, non-stop. Robin, who's in the crew, was diagnosed a couple of years ago at the age of 43.

We have Oxford Brookes University running tests on Robin and Billy (similar age, doesn't have PD) throughout the row to compare how they cope mentally and physically. As they'll both be doing the same amount of rowing and eating the same controlled diet it should be a fair test.

They'll also be looking to see if the repetitive nature of rowing and the gained muscle memory will help Robin with his Parkinson's.

1227,question about dopamine: overexertion and depression,FreshProject,6,8jdq0d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parkinsons/comments/8jdq0d/question_about_dopamine_overexertion_and/,9,1526344669.0,"I recently moved in with a relative with parkinsons (stage 3) to help out with housework, lawn maintenance, and whatever comes up as the disease progresses.  I've been trying to identify what I'm looking at when I see him really down emotionally, be it depression, demoralization, or just meds.  I'm flat out ruling out depression, because most days he's upbeat, laughing, and has no signs of loss of motivation or energy.  No part of me doubts demoralization is in play though, just from talking with him.  So I'm just trying to better understand the meds portion of this, and I think I noticed a trend: when he really overdoes it physically, I *think* those seem to be the days when he's at his lowest emotionally in-between doses and at night.  

So if I understand how parkinsons works, he more or less can't create his own dopamine, and gets his via levodopa which allows him to move.  And as far as I know, dopamine also plays a big part into emotional states.  So is this a thing?  If you overexert yourself physically, can that cause you to  ""use up"" the dopamine from the levodopa faster than if you weren't as active during that dose, leaving you in a rut emotionally until it's time for the next dose?  

I know a previous doctor at some point told him his active lifestyle is probably why his disease has progressed as slowly as it has (~12 years in), but I'm also pretty sure he said his current doctor keeps telling him he needs to exercise *less* and quit working, which might be related if this is how the dopamine works.  I'll be heading to future doctor's appointments with him to be a bit more informed, but in the meantime I'd love some accounts from other people with first hand experience on this stuff.

My biggest question regards a concern that the medicine thickens throughout the day and clogs the tube some time during the day, stopping flow. When i do the flush at night, there is a strong resistance within the tube to plunging the flush syringe. The pump should make an alarm noise if something is blocking the flow-- but would this apply to a thickening of the medicine throughout the day that SLOWS the flow of medicine?

To be sure, tremors are a typical symptom. But, the disease manifests itself in many other ways as well. Some physical, like the gradual loss of agility, mobility and balance. Some non-physical, like cognitive impairment and chemically induced depression (through the loss of serotonin produced by the brain).

For me, restless legs at night is part of the experience. Known commonly as “restless leg syndrome,” this affliction is aptly named; when I lie down in bed, my left leg shakes. Given that most Parkinson’s patients already suffer from sleep disorders, restless legs while trying to sleep simply adds to the challenge. 

Which brings me to the other night. Sunday, I woke around midnight. My left leg was shaking to beat the band. “Hmmm,” I said to myself, unable to fall back to sleep. “Maybe I should go downstairs and get something to help.”

This is a frequent occurrence. Sometimes I try aspirin. Sometimes a sleep aid. There doesn’t seem to be any magic bullet unfortunately.

But I remain optimistic that a cure will be found for RLS and the myriad of other afflcitions that affect the central nervous system (ALS, Parkinson's, MS, etc.). And in that regard, I try to do my part in the name of science. In addition to aspirins and sleep aids, I have also tried beet juice, rhythmic deep breathing exercises, and warm milk (to name just a few). I just keep thinking that, someday, someone is going to try that one weird, unlikely combination of things and it is going to work. Restless legs will become a thing of the past.

Back to Sunday night, I felt particularly creative as I walked gingerly down the stairs. Maybe tonight was the night. Maybe I was about to solve the ages old mystery of restless legs. By the time I reached the last step, my mind was made up. In the name of science, I was about to step boldly were no one else had ever tread. In the name of science, I decided to eat a taco. (Actually, a three-day old taco.)

And it worked! Kind of. I mean, my legs didn’t stop shaking immediately. But about an hour after I took a handful of Rolaids to help with the whopper case of indigestion I experienced, I noticed that my leg had stopped shaking.

Go figure!

But it left so many questions unanswered. What if the taco had been two days old instead of three? What about four days old? What if it had come from Taco Bueno instead of Taco Bell? Would the results have been the same?

Anyway, Monday night it happened again. I awoke in the wee hours of the morning to find my left leg shaking. Wanting to build on the success I had experienced the night before, I headed straight to the kitchen. Since I didn’t have any three day old tacos left, I had to improvise. Staring me in the face was a half eaten plate of brownies.

“I wonder,” I murmured, staring off blankly. “Maybe with a scoop of the vanilla ice cream on top. In the name of science.”

Light is the arch enemy of sleep. So, as an additional step, I decided to eat my brownie and vanilla ice cream on the porch, lit only by the moon. There was something very soothing about sitting outside in the early morning as I consumed my treat.

Sweet and succulent, it was. Spoonful by delicious spoonful, I dug into it amidst the dark, peaceful, sedate night air. If this wouldn’t slow down an over-revved nervous system, I didn’t know what would.

Then, finally, the Pièce de Résistance; that last incredible spoonful in all its rich, decadent glory. Brownie crumbs lying in a tranquil pool of melted vanilla ice cream.

It’s difficult for me to describe the peace that settled into my being at that moment. Alone in the dark, eating brownies and ice cream.

And then it happened. For the second time in two months I experienced an unexpected savory flavor that couldn’t be identified immediately.

""What is that?"" I asked myself. Then it came to me. Stink bug. I had eaten another fricken stink bug. (See http://www.crfenergy.com/stink-bugs-1.html for the first time I inadvertently ate a stink bug.)

It was disgusting. In the interest of science, however, I should report that my leg did stop shaking about an hour later — just as it had during the previous night’s taco experiment. So, I dunno.

Of course, it could be completely unrelated. (For instance, maybe the two 16 oz beers I chugged trying to get rid of the awful taste in my mouth?) Twelve hours later everything still tastes like stink bug.

Conclusion? While both approaches seemed to work in their own roundabout way, at the margin, I tend to believe Sunday night’s result was better than Monday’s.

And for that reason, although a close call, I recommend tacos with antacids over stink bugs with brownies and ice cream for people suffering from RLS.

Of course, I’m not a doctor so . . . .

I don't really know where to start or what to do. My dad is 74, a Vietnam Veteran, spent 25 years in the US Navy. My mom is 64 and has fibromyalga and RA. My dad went from being the bread winner, the guy who taught me about cars, the guy who did wood work... to someone who struggles to hold a cup. This diagnosis is very recent; he's only started working with a Dr to find the right medications for him. He was on one, but it made him extra irritable. They switched to a new one, but I'm not sure the name. 

As the youngest of 3, it's always been known that I would be the one to care for my parents. I have 2 older siblings. 1 lives across the country, and is a very entitled and overall rude person (even though she is improving) and isn't in the greatest of health herself. My middle sister and her 3 kids live with my parents but my middle sister is... unstable (undiagnosed personality disorder, visit r/raisedbynarcissists and thats her). At the moment, my parents house is a very stressful place. Then there's me. Married, steady career, and a new baby. 

I'm not sure what I'm really looking for. I definitely feel the pressure of the impending caregiver role. I work full time and can't afford to quit, but I'm not sure how long I can realistically expect my parents to live independently. Currently, they live about 25 miles away from me. It's the joy of being in the sandwich generation, caring for a baby and parents. It breaks my heart that my dad is too scared to hold the baby because of his shakes and grip. I'm just not sure what to do for them. My dad is fiercely independent, so I don't want to baby him. I don't know if there's products to make his life easier. I found a Rock Steady Boxing gym about 50 miles from his house, I'm sure we could got once or twice, but not often. 

What helps people keep their independence ? Is there something you wished your family would do or say? Anyone know a good resource in Arizona? Should I send him daily pictures of cactus' wearing hats?",2018-04-30 03:35:32

Once my grandmother got Parkinson's, he took care of her a lot. Even though she was still very capable, he helped her out whenever possible.

Then, when my grandfather got dementia, they moved to a smaller home. For three years, they still lived on their own. It was clear my grandfather's situation was getting worse and worse. We only found out after a while that, eithout telling anyone, my grandmother had been keeping him alive on her own. She made sure he ate, helping him with every bite for the last year or so; he himself didn't think about wanting to eat anymore. 

Then they moved to a hospice: my grandfather under a lot of care, my grandmother in the open department (with specialisation in Parkinson's). She visited him every day for weeks, even when he became barely responsive. He barely spoke, lost lots of weight and became a shadow of his former self. Not long after that, he passed away.

My grandmother had gotten worse too; terrible eyesight, hazy short term memory (early onset dementia, though it luckily never progressed), physical problems (low weight, difficulty walking) and worsened Parkinson's. For the first few weeks after my grandfather's death, she was visibly sad. They had been married for over 50 years, and knew each other for much longer. But after the funeral, she blossomed: where she'd before visit my grandfather, she now took part in activities and actively enjoyed it even more when family visited. For the first time in decades, she lived on her own. 

This went on for about one more year. On a beautiful day, she and her three daughters had a beautiful day: they went to a nice place, had a nice walk through nature, had dinner and all that. Two weeks later, she passed away. Honestly I believe she finally lived just for herself and thought it had been enough; she had enjoyed her life with her children and grandchildren, even having a great-grandchild. In the end I think she was satisfied with it all and didn't see a reason to keep going. 

I don't know exactly why I started typing this story. I think it was something like 'sometimes wifes go after their husbands too', but I kind of dragged myself along memory lane and couldn't stop... But I want to post it anyway, even if it is just the stupidest little bit on the internet, if that means the story is stored somewhere.

My grandmother was diagnosed in 2012. I was away at college by that point so I wasn't there. Each time I come to visit it's like seeing a different person. 

My mom has been primary caregiver since day 1 of the diagnosis. My grandmother made the decisions that she should stop driving, chose when to sign power of attorney to my mom, declared she was DNR if anything happened, all of it on her own before things ""got bad.""

Now we're in what I think is the last few months, but my mom thinks she'll be around for my wedding next summer. 

Honestly, as horrible as it is, I hope she isn't. She's skin and bone. Won't eat more than popcorn and candy. Still has some good days but even her good days aren't normal. 

My mom thinks the doctors aren't doing everything they can. She's in denial. 

Now, she's moving my grandma into her house because she was kicked out of hospice (I don't know why.)

I want to be supportive, but I'm not in the area and can rarely visit. I have my own family to take care of and my own anxiety and depression over several things. 

My mom refuses to go to therapy, she has very few friends that she sees, my dad and brother are zero help emotional-support wise, so all of the unloading she needs is falling on mine and my fiance's shoulders. 

I want this horrible disease to go away. I want my grandma to stop suffering. I want my mom to have a normal life. 

I don't really know what the point if this is, but I have to believe someone here can relate. ",2018-04-18 01:57:11

I feel like I'm getting the flu every day and I often have chills as well. I experience weakness in my arms and legs and sometimes have trouble holding onto things so I drop things a lot. I've had many MRIs and I do have brain damage to my frontal lobe in the form of white matter abnormalities I have been evaluated by specialist for Ms and fibromyalgia epilepsy among other things and have come up negative for all of those things I have been evaluated for Parkinson's and they say that I don't have that.

PARKINSON'S DISEASE

STATISTICS: Men are one and a half times more likely to be diagnosed with Parkinson's disease than women, according to the Parkinson's Foundation. Women also tend to be diagnosed much later, long after symptoms are present.

DIAGNOSIS: Because more men than women are diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, primary care doctors are less likely to consider it in women who have the symptoms, says Maria De Leon, MD, a neurologist and movement disorders specialist in Nacogdoches, TX, who has Parkinson's disease herself. She's also a research advocate for the Parkinson's Foundation. In 2010, Robin Morgan, an award-winning feminist writer and activist in New York City, was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease after being misdiagnosed for a year and a half. She was quite sure the tremor in her hands was a sign of Parkinson's, given that her mother had the disease, but her doctor dismissed the possibility. Still, she considers herself fortunate because, she says, “I know women who've waited seven years for a diagnosis.” To raise awareness of sex and gender differences in Parkinson's disease and to encourage research into women-specific issues, the Parkinson's Disease Foundation—a forerunner to the Parkinson's Foundation—launched the Women and PD Initiative in 2015.

SYMPTOMS: “Women present more with affective disorders [such as depression], cognitive changes, fatigue, and stiffness—not the tremors people recognize [as a hallmark of Parkinson's disease],” Dr. De Leon says. “Women have better survival rates, but they turn out to be more disabled and have a lower quality of life,” says Allison Willis, MD, assistant professor of neurology and biostatistics and epidemiology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia.

MEDICATIONS: Some drugs prescribed for Parkinson's disease can cause bones to thin, which may heighten the chance of developing osteoporosis, especially for women who are already at risk for it. Women may also be more vulnerable to side effects—such as nausea, sleepiness, dizziness, and headaches—than men, Dr. De Leon says. As a result, women may need lower doses or more time to adjust to the drugs.

HORMONES: Estrogen, a predominantly female hormone, has a somewhat protective effect. Researchers believe it may inhibit inflammation, which is common in Parkinson's disease. Or the hormone may increase the release and expression of growth factors in the cells surrounding neurons that are responsible for ensuring and maintaining the survival of those neurons, Dr. De Leon says. Either theory may explain why the risk of developing Parkinson's disease increases after menopause when estrogen levels drop significantly. It may also explain why “women who have induced menopause—their ovaries are removed early—have the same incidence of Parkinson's disease as men,” Dr. Willis says.

MENSTRUAL CYCLE: Younger women who have Parkinson's disease face a vicious cycle when it comes to menstruation. “Parkinson's disease makes periods worse—longer, heavier, and sometimes more painful—and periods can make Parkinson's symptoms worse,” says Dr. De Leon. “Parkinson's medications can also influence the menstrual cycle, making periods irregular.”
BIRTH CONTROL PILLS: The effects of birth control pills aren't well established, but since hormonal fluctuations affect symptoms, using birth control pills to shorten the length and lessen the severity of periods might help manage symptoms, Dr. De Leon says.

PREGNANCY: Several reports of successful pregnancies in women with Parkinson's disease have been published, but medications need to be chosen carefully during pregnancy. Levodopa has been shown to be safe, but some medications for Parkinson's disease can cause birth defects if they're taken during pregnancy.

Answer as many or as few questions as you want. The better the data the more impact it will have.

Survey Link: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/redditdiets
 
The Data: All of the data will be made openly available in an unedited format in select intervals during survey collection and upon survey completion. It will be posted to both this thread and in a new unveiling post. I'm hoping for some serious throw downs amongst the various analytical subreddits on what can be gleaned from the results.

Motivation: As someone who's watched friends cycle through dozens of diets in attempts to address everything from diabetes to allergies I've been astounded by the variety of what different people say works for them. There are so many dietary fads these days and a lot of pseudoscience, but one thing that is undeniable is the sheer variety of diets that work for cultures around the world. The goal of this survey is to see if quantitative trends can be found supporting, if only anecdotally, the use of specific diets for addressing specific or general health concerns. In an attempt to make the survey brief yet impactful questions are limited to broader categories.    

Questions: All questions are optional and include Diet, Health Outcome, Age, and Gender.

At this moment he has to say im fine. But in the future he may not. As things become measurable.  In the mean time I have POTS and Possibly something else.  Another doc thinks my excessive thirst is a symptom of CONNS syndrom. Waiting on the test for that.

So i was reading that pretty much a genetic test is the only way to figure it out because eopd is alwaya genetic.  I have no desire to go in and beg doctors for this. Because a diagnosis today isn't that important. But I'm also not crazy about the idea of deteriorating to the point of getting meds to finally slow progression. Seems counter productive.


My question comes from a post I saw some where. The guy had done the 23 and me test and was simply asking how to avoid getting it or something.


   The 23 and me tests 2 variants in the lrrk2 and gba genes.   Now. This will not cover all the PARK and PINk variants.  

I understand gettimg this test does not mean I have it. And even if the test comes up negative, it doesn't mean I don't have it.  Am I correct on this?

To people who might have some thing important to say. Because I'm kind of a mess right now.  And I feel crazy.

So I have every symptom of early onset parkinsons. EVERY SYMPTOM. It doesn't matter what website I am reading on, what info, what any thing. I HAVE ANY THING THEY LIST.  Which I totally get could be any number of things, and going into this i was not dead set that I have eopd. Just that it fit more than any thing. I've looked at a lot of other illnesses. 



SO MY FIRST ""NEuRUO"". I drove 6 hours one way with two almost two year olds. She was not an neurologist. She was a nurse practitioner. Who has zero neuro specific certs.  I had made a list of symptoms. Because, I had to wait two months and drive half a day. So I sit down and it's a fucking witch hunt.  I say, ""the first time I showed symptoms of POTS I was x age, but it went away"" She just about yells at me, ""You don't have POTS"". ok...I never said I did.  she continues, ""does your heart race?"" I said, I don't know, let me see. And I kneel down. ""what are you doing get up"" she says. I say I was trying to find out if my heart raced when I blacked out (because it happens almost every time I stand). SHe tells me I am being ridiculous and to get off the ground. So I slide into my chair, because I don't trust this fucking woman to catch me if I fall. She continues, by chewing me out for using the words ""blacking out"". She seriously had an issue with every single term I had for ten minutes. Including contradicting herself just to fight with me. She tells me that since I've never actually fallen from it that I have managed it just fine.  Yeah, laying on the bathroom floor and holding myself against walls or my husband until I can SEE again while parenting three kids is totally managed. 

I might add I am very timid. So I wasn't arguing back. I was trying desperately to appease her so that she would listen to me. 

Moving on. She tediously writes every thing down. Finally when I am about half way through my list she says, ""it sounds like you think you have a lot of things wrong with you.""  I explain, no, I had a list of symptoms, I'm at the doctor, and I was explaining things that have just started..

She then gives me the standard normal parkinsons test. I don't have weakness on one side. I don't shuffle my feet. I'm not always suffering a balance issue, but some times am. EOPD doesn't usually present with this.  She then tells me that I show zero symptoms of parkinsons. I tell her that I literally just read a list of EOPD symptoms. 

I tell her my hands are numb and she ignores me. I ask what am I supposed to do about the new cognitive issues. She tells me to get a second opinion and go to speech therapy.  Mind you she isn't offering me a referral for it. Or even offering to help me find it. She just keeps telling me to get another opinion. that it isn't her problem. and that speech therapy should be enough for ""my sudden cognitive issues"".   

She then started asking me what kind of drugs I used. didn't believe I didn't smoke pot. and didn't believe I didn't drink. I have a facial piercing. so I'm assuming she was profiling me.   She would not even look at my list a second time. She would no look for anything it might be that is going on.  (you know because all the hard drug users are seeking ladopa)

After this horrible interaction she asked to come out to the waiting room and see my babies. ... Seriously. 


So the next morining I call the hospital and talk to them and they get me into see the real neurologist. 

He was wonderful. Because of the earlier interaction, I was terrified of speaking. So I made a list. with when the symptom started. He really liked that. I said I kind of ramble and I think it might have been part of the issue yesterday. He did quite a bit more. But it was still the standard test. Our entire state doesn't have any means of doing a more advanced test.  (datscan)

I might add, he used the words ""black out"" to describe when I was losing my sight and falling over. He (with out me saying any thing) said I definitely had POTS and carried on and on about how hard it is to diagnose (which the NP said the opposite). It should be easy to diagnose with me because it happens almost every time I stand up. He said he thought I had carpal tunnel. He did a little test with a metal hammer, but nothing fancy. At the time my pinky finger was unaffected. But that was just then. I mentioned that. But he was pretty sure it was carpal tunnel.  I don't recall if I pushed onset, or both hands.

He addressed my tremors, which she refused to do. He said I had a pathologic tremor that was turning into an essential tremor, that was probably on the verge of needing to be medicated ( I cut myself 4 times last week).  He actually listened to me when I said my thumb had a different type of tremor. He said, if he could see every thing on my list, he would have a different opinion. But he can't diagnose what he can't see. He felt like the thumb tremor was probably the start of a parkinsons tremor ( I showed it to him by moving my thumb with my other hand haha). and that if he could see every thing we might be talking about an EOPD med. But for now, we are saying I don't have it. And waiting till it becomes measurable.  Same with the confusion. I was too articulate for him to notice any thing wrong. It comes and goes.  

He then asked me about what happened the day before and told me the woman was new. I was not the first to complain. She sounded horrible. And couldn't believe how fucking awkward it must have been to have been so upset and showing this woman my kids. .  and it was. it felt good to hear it. He validated me. 

but he gave me very few answers.


I've been researching POTS and assuming that getting it treated will at least make me significantly less miserable. I was more than surprised it caused so many other problems.

I've been asking friends, and the reddits about carpal tunnel. because I'm just not sure it's whats wrong. Peripheral neuropathy is a symptom of genetic parkinsons. and in order for it to fit my symptoms I would have had to get carpal tunel x2 and cubital tunnel x2 exactly at the same time.  it doesn't explain that I get pressure behind my eyes when the sensations get stronger. and that I have the same sensation in my feet. 

That said. I am 100 % willing to go to the doc tomorrow and talk about treating the carpal tunnel and pots. Though I will express my concern that it is not carpal tunnel. 


In the last two weeks the hand and foot numbness has gone from none (except when I was about to fall asleep) to pretty unbearable almost all the time. 

I'm talking to my husband about getting a green card. Because If I literally have to sit around and wait for this to get worse, I at least want to be less miserable.  I really really am hoping treating the pots will help though. 

I'm just kind of ... bleh..

bleh because I have no real answers about every thing. Neither of them were willing to look past my idea of EOPD. I didn't want them to be blinded by my idea. I figured they would say, ""No way it's EOPD!!! BUt you do have!"" .. but he covered two symptoms and then didn't know. haha.. ugh!!  

ugh...  thanks for reading. if you did.

but im alwyas waking up very very tired and with microshaking and i only feel like i was half  asleep and the dreaming are pretty livid u used to also have  very emotional backlash from the dream, say i killed someone in a dream i would wake up as if i did it for real after a minute that feeling goes down pretty fast about 10 minutes but you can guess if i would dream i kill my kid that feeling is horrible.

sometimes i take me normal dose of 2 xsinemet and a contam and i fall is sleep again for most of the time and i feel more relaxed and less dreaming affect then i just woke up with the sinemat regulated realse with the diazepam and meatonine.

anyone had those symthoms as well and had success by changing it so something else becuase even tho i sleep i feel so tired i need 1+ to recover and never feel rested(only one time 2 weeks ago i had a bad argument with my oldest daughter and it took so much energy that i whent to bad after taking my normal dose of 2 sinemet and a comtan ansd set the alarm clock foor 23:30 and then i took my nighs meds ad set the clock for 08:00 and fell asleep again till 08:00 without having heave dreams of waking up just about 11 hours of none stop sleeping , and i woke up in heaven the next morning hadnt had  that good of a sleep since 2 years now....and i like to get that back..the bad sleeping is slowly killing me i dont wanna sleep becuase of the dreams and when i wake up im depressed also its just wearing me down.

It came fast and what initially seemed to just be a movement issue has now escalated into more.  

He was taken to the hospital about a month ago having aspirated and then refused PT etc, so they gave him in home care.  He has a PT person, a speech person, and a nurse come out during the week. Due to this he is not allowed to leave the house or he loses the in home care. 

That being said he cannot be alone.   He falls quite a lot even with a walker etc. 

My reason for coming here is to try and help my mother who is completely overwhelmed.  In a very short time it went from helping to now being at home almost 24/7 with him, and I don't think either were ready.  They are both in their mid 60's.

Things are getting tense in that household and myself and sister are not quite sure what to do about this.  

Caregiver questions:
How can we make her understand she needs to find a support group?  

We need to get her to realize they/she needs in home help, but she keeps saying she feels guilty having someone else take care of him, yet she can't do it. 

Are there any other/better resources than say the Visiting Angels?  They're both worried about cost.  My parents have money saved but in no way are rich.  I think the concept of what it would cost to have someone there even a few hours a week is scary over time.  They have amazing insurance but from what I can see no insurance covers anything like this. 

How do you motivate a patient that doesn't seem motivated on their own.  My step father does what he's told when his speech/pt/nurse are there but doesn't do his stuff on his own.  It's very frustrating to everyone, including my mother as she has to take care of him but sees him not putting forth the effort. 

This post is sort of all over and I apologize for that, I'm just trying to get my bearings here as to what I can do to help.  Plus find out how others are doing this sort of thing.

My mom has advanced Parkinson's and was having trouble communicating with people and with her Echo (she's super tech-savvy). She asked me about getting a microphone/speaker set up, so this took up some time over the holidays.

Doing research with assistive devices and others it became clear that most such are designed for people who need something for like an hour or less, like speakers or exercise class instructors or musicians. Having something constantly plugged in and operating is a different ballgame, but this is what we worked out.

* Collar microphone, known in the trade as a lavalier or lav mic--many cheap options available
* Microphone preamp with phantom power--hard to find one without breaking the bank, but [this!](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002GZZNY/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_U_x_9dBFAbCGP9J1E) seems to be working well.
* Small speaker with a line input: again, many cheap options but we found an Anker about the size of a shoe that works pretty well
* 3.5mm cord to connect the preamp to the speaker

The only two plugs are the preamp and the speaker, so we plugged them both into a smart outlet and set it up as an Alexa skill. When the staff at her residential community gets her up for the day, they clip the mic onto her collar and they or she says, ""Alexa, turn on microphone"" and it turns on, then turns off at the end of the day.

After a month, it seems to be working pretty well, so I thought I'd pass it along in case anyone would find the same setup helpful.",2018-02-09 22:37:19

For approx. last 18mo. or so I've started noticing periods of - I guess I would just describe it as 'dizzy' - but not a normal dizzy.  It's like the space around me suddenly feels disconnected from my internal sense of balance - like walking on a waterbed or something.  My head swims, my sense of balance gets reduced and I'm always afraid it's going to cause me to go lurching/stumbling into a wall or something.  I know many people suffer from falls due to freezing, or they trip over themselves but I've always wondered - ""What is the sensation they feel just before it happens?""

.

_I have been teaching people to meditate for a very long time, but I always appreciate seeing the unique way it affects different people. Case in point: when I had the opportunity to teach actor Michael J Fox. It started when I got a call during half-time while I was attending a New York Knicks game at Madison Square Garden._

_It was Tracy Pollan, Michael’s wife. She wanted to set up a time for Michael to learn to meditate. As we were hammering out dates, I discussed some of the benefits that the meditation could bring to Michael, who I knew had been battling Parkinson’s disease since the early Nineties. At the end of the conversation I asked Tracy offhandedly: “Is Michael looking forward to learning?”_

_“Oh, God, he doesn’t know,” she said with a laugh. “I haven’t told him yet — it’s a surprise!”_

_Michael must have liked the surprise because he came to our office several weeks later to learn. Before we began, he told me he had not taken any of his medications that day that help to control his tremors. He wanted to see objectively the degree to which meditating calmed him down. Michael on tremor-reducing meds is how you see him on television and in public spaces._

_Michael off meds is how almost no one sees him, save for his family and closest friends. In fact, after decades with PD, as many people with Parkinson’s call it, Michael’s tremors had become more pronounced. I sat across from Michael in my office, both of us in comfortable chairs. I gave him his mantra and explained how to use it properly. He closed his eyes and began to meditate. Within seconds — literally seconds — all his tremors ceased. I am not talking gradually subsided, but just stopped. Stunned by what I saw, I closed my eyes and meditated with him. A few minutes later, when we both were done meditating, I looked over at him, and he was staring at his hands, which lay motionless on his lap. He sat like that for several more minutes, just looking at his hands._

_“This moment,” he said, “is the calmest I have felt in years. Decades.”_

_I wondered if he would have the same experience the next time he meditated at home. We met the following day and, sure enough, he said the same thing happened._

_A week later he told me it was still happening when he meditated at home. Whenever he did TM [transcendental meditation], the tremors ceased. He said he had begun sleeping more soundly through the night whereas before he would wake up every one or two hours._

_A month later, in another visit, Michael recalled how uncharacteristically relaxed he felt immediately prior to delivering an hour-long talk on Parkinson’s before a large audience in Toronto. In the past, he confided, he would have sat backstage, fretting anxiously over every word he planned to say. This time he meditated for 20 minutes in the green room, walked out on stage, and gave one of the best talks of his life._

_Although Michael’s tremors do inevitably return after he finishes his 20-minute meditation, for him the big thing has been the significant reduction in anxiety levels and the dramatic overall improvement in his quality of life._

The Michael J Fox Foundation and the David Lynch Foundation have been [doing fund-raising to do research to see if this is a fluke or if TM really does have such an effect on people with PD.](http://pages.s7.exacttarget.com/Share.aspx?i=609bfa8aa54fad22baa5504d8afc0dc11b12756d790f8dbc)",2018-01-29 10:19:40
1385,GDNF proteins,Vapala,2,7ss4i3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parkinsons/comments/7ss4i3/gdnf_proteins/,5,1516871159.0,"I am an iboga amateur.

A huge field of interest in the field of PD are the GDNF proteins. It is a protein created by your glial cells. Among other things, they maintain and repair damaged dopaminergic neurons in your brain, the ones dying when you have PD. 

For about 20 years, the pharmaceutical industry has been trying to deliver those proteins by various mean through the blood-brain-barrier with relative success. I think even the MJ Fox foundation funded one of those research.

There is one natural substance that increase those GDNF proteins in your brain. It is called ibogaine, an alkaloid from a plant in Africa. 

(Dorit et Al, 2006) found even more: they found out that ibogaine not only increase the GDNF protein, but upregulate their expression for a little while!

Unfortunately, since they cannot patent a natural plant, since they tried and failed to ""mimic"" a synthetic workable molecule like ibogaine, since it is illegal in the US, since it is scarce in Gabon and because of severe side effect at high dose, it cannot be commercialized by the big pharmaceutical and hence isn't used.

Instead they prefer to investigate ways to deliver external GDNF proteins by different mechanical means like intra-cranial injections because they can’t create a med that pass the blood-brain-barrier. This way would be much more marketable for them.
 
The effect of those GDNF proteins could alleviate some of the symptoms, slow the disease by repairing some of the damaged, dying neurons. 
I do not think science consider it as a cure. They don’t know why your dopaminergic neurons dies. They simply know those proteins helps them not die, repair, maintain them, etc.

If you live in Canada or a country where ibogaine is legal, I would try to talk about it to my physician. Ibogaine is a hallucinogen and comes with severe side effects at high dose but one can do moderate dosage (like I do for spiritual reasons) and avoid those side effect.

Ibogaine is cheap: buying it from reputable vendor online will cost you around 250$ USA per gram with shipping. With 1 gram, you can do many moderate dosage, avoid unpleasant side effect and have those proteins repair your dopaminergic neurons.

There are clinics in Canada or Mexico that treat drug addicts with ibogaine (by the same mechanism, it is an anti-addicting drug, addicts having some damage to those neurons as well) in a medically supervised setting. They usually charge 5000$ for the entire treatment for about 500$ worth of ibogaine. So it is not for every purse. 

If I were you, I would try to talk about this with my physician. It's not like ibogaine is a new molecule that hasn’t been tested. It is used by the Bwitti population in Africa as a healing plant for a long time and was tested extensively on animals, is taken for spiritual reasons by many people and by addicts to repair their damaged dopaminergic neurons, etc. It was popular in the 60s with Olympic athletes for its clean stimulation. It was sold in France as a mild stimulant etc. It has been consumed for centuries unlike many of the meds found today.

If you can get your hand on some, make sure you discuss it with your physician. There were a few deaths following massive (flood) dose of ibogaine. You can read about it here   https://www.ibogainealliance.org/ibogaine/therapy/safety/   
 
Those deaths were after a huge massive dose of ibogaine. Stay in the small/moderate range, arrange it with your physician, maybe you could get a nurse to assist you while you do it. Once you have done it once or twice, you will decide if you still need that nurse. I do all my iboga alone in the small/moderate range. 

After taking ibogaine, you will feel a mild stimulation, a small antidepressant effect and you will feel a little drugged. You could take 100-150mg per day, a moderate dosage without much side effect, and do your day kind of normally: no driving, no heavy machinery but you can read, watch TV, converse with your spouse etc. I would redo it for 5-7 days. I do up to 400mg ibogaine by myself alone but everyone is different and you need medical supervision at higher dosage. The best is to do it with someone, like a nurse, then, if your physician agrees, do it with your spouse or alone. 150 mg of ibogaine HCL is 1/10 of a flood dose i.e. safe range. 

After that, I would wait a few weeks, feel the improvement and go back to the physician to get revaluated. 

You cannot take it if you take any antidepressant to avoid a serotonergic syndrome as it blocks the recapture of serotonin like a SSRI.

Your heart needs to be tested (EKG), all the info is easy to find for your physician.

I have nothing to sell. My interest here is only altruistic, feel free to ask me any question.

They don’t want you to use iboga because its not marketable for them; but they have been trying for 20 years to do exactly what ibogaine do. Think about it.

He tends to drop the cup a lot and will only drink a little bit. Does anyone have any tips to get around this? Also, does anyone have any products that he can use to help him eat or drink?

Several things I read have said that Parkinson's has to do with dopamine levels, which are affected by both Celexa and Luvox.  While these symptoms started about a year or so ago, they seem to be getting worse lately.  I am wondering if it could be due to the Luvox?  Does anyone have experience with this?

The main symptoms I have been having are:

involuntary finger jerks - this happens to either hand

head rocking?  I don't really know what it's called, but if I sit still, my head will sometimes start to rock back and forth (forward and backwards) kind of ""in tune"" with my heartbeat?  I can make it stop, but if I stop thinking about it, I go back to rocking or nodding.

1402,"Mom (who has PD) has excruciating abdominal pain, doctors can't figure out cause or how to alleviate symptoms.",BKNES,2,7r7aca,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parkinsons/comments/7r7aca/mom_who_has_pd_has_excruciating_abdominal_pain/,7,1516279473.0,"My 75-year old mother was diagnosed with Parkinson's 11 years ago.  She was doing pretty well for the first 10 years, having been physically active and watched her diet throughout her life, but the last few months her symptoms have taken a very severe downturn.

In the last 3 weeks she's been having pain flashes in her abdomen that have been so excruciating that she will literally scream and cry and wail, sometimes for hours straight.  This pain is accompanied by really pronounced bloating of the belly-- I personally witnessed it being so swollen that her belly button popped out as an ""outie.""

When she doesn't have the pain flashes, she feels nauseous and afraid to eat, and will have bouts of diarrhea.

She recently had pain flashes so bad that she was hospitalized twice.  The doctors ran a bunch of tests but still can't figure out what exactly is going on or how to alleviate her symptoms.

My sister & I are sincerely concerned that our mom is going to die if doctors don't find the cause or at least figure out a way to ease her pain.

2) What the doctors did and what they gleaned:
-Abdominal CT Scan:  
She was constipated, with lots of stool.  They gave her 2 enemas, which cleared her out, but did not alleviate her pain flashes.

-Her bladder was enormous and retaining a lot of fluid.  When she was released it was normal.

-The doctors doesn't think she has gastroparesis.

-She had an enlarged pancreatic duct, which can be a sign of or precursor to cancer.  This led them to do an MRI.

-MRI:  This showed no tumors in her pancreas or stomach

-Endoscopy all the way to stomach: she does have tiny stomach abrasions, probably from past ulcers.

-Blood Tests: These came back OK
-EKG:  Her heart is OK. 
-Colonoscopy: She had this last summer, she has one polyp in her colon which seems benign
-She was tested for H. Pylori, the test came back negative
-The gastroenterologist at UVA was not helpful, he basically told her that it was all probably related to ""stress.""  He ruled out GERD.

-The PCP is trying to get a neurologist to weigh in. Right now the PCP doesn't think my mother's symptoms are related to her meds.

3) Mother's current medications:
Carbidopa-Levodopa (Sinemet); 25 -100 TAB: 1.5 tablets by mouth, 5 times daily (7.5 a day)
Rytary ER 48.75; MG-195 MG CAP:  3 capsules by mouth nightly
Mirtazaphine 30 MG: 1 tablet by mouth nightly
Carbidopa/Levo E; 25-100 TAB: 8 tablets a day
Pantoprazole 40 MG delayed: 1 tablet by mouth 2 times a day (repair stomach)
Oscimin 0.125 MG SL tablet: 1 tablet under the tongue as needed for bowel cramping
TraMADol 50 MG tablet: 1 tablet by mouth as needed for pain
Ondansetron: 1 1/2 tablet every few hours as needed for nausea
Another Nausea Med-- I think it's Zofran, but the package is hard to read
Zolpidem Tartrate (Ambien); 5 MG Tablet: 1 tablet at bedtime for sleep

I was concerned that maybe the pain was related to too many meds (of course a lot of the above were prescribed in response to her pain), the doctors don't seem to think that's the case.

My family want the doctors to perform an EEG (record electric activity in brain) to see if it's seizure-related (e.g. abdominal seizure).  They have yet to agree, I think for insurance reasons.

Has anyone here experienced a similar situation or symptoms?  Things are  getting worse every day.

The DBS has been very helpful and amazing in some ways. I was there when they first activated it and his tremor immediately stopped.

My brother was diagnosed with Parkinson's about a year and a half ago, and he's been pretty freaked out about it. Recently, another brother of mine wanted to give the ketogenic diet a try to treat his type 2 diabetes. So I started reading about the ketogenic diet and found that a lot of lofty claims have been made about it, including that it might be effective in preventing or treating Parkinson's. I was only able to find one study that was only done with seven people. The results were positive, but the study was inconclusive because they couldn't rule out the placebo effect. But there's a lot of optimism out there about further studies. Anyway, I'm just curious about anecdotal evidence. I haven't been able to find much on that. Have any of you ever tried a ketogenic diet for whatever reason, and if so, did it have any affect on your Parkinson's symptoms? Thanks. Oh, I should also add that my brother asked his doctor today about the keto diet and its efficacy against Parkinson's, and his doctor pooh poohed it.

My father-in-law is 82 years old and has been diagnosed with Parkinson's for about a year and a half now. This man is the best father to me that I could imagine and I love him accordingly. My wife and I want to do the best for him and my mother-in-law.

A few days after Christmas he woke up in the middle of the night and believed people were in his room trying to sell it. He got up, got dressed and left the house without waking up my mother-in-law (who had taken to sleeping in a different room for both of their comfort) He went out, got into his car and drove off at about 4 am. About an hour later he was knocking on the door of a nearby retirement home who called the police, who returned him home. This is absolutely heartbreaking for us.

We contacted his neurologist and Primary Care Physician who referred us to the local hospital for a CT scan. The CT scan came back that there was no stroke, and they said the hallucinations were likely due to a urinary tract infection. UTI's are treatable, but Parkinson's is degenerative. We are not naive enough to believe that just having him take some anti-biotics for the UTI will be a sufficient solution.

My in-laws really, REALLY do not want to go into assisted living and my wife and I aren't ready to push that issue now- we want them to be happy in their home, but also safe.

Does anyone have any suggestions about making the house safer?

My mother-in-law has moved back into the bedroom with my father-in-law. I am thinking about adding some alarms to the doors that will go off if they are opened, or we have seen mats that you can lay in front of doors that will sound an alarm when stepped on.

My father-in-law gets confused, but is always in great spirits- he never gets combative, so as long as my mother-in-law knows he is leaving, she can keep him from going.

If anyone has any ideas/experience/suggestions on this, I would be beyond thankful to hear them.

Thank you for your time

My take -- yes this does occur some years after diagnosis. Sleep is critical for all of use if you are only sleeping three or four hours a night, your brain is getting overworked. Do everything you can to reduce stress, and get a good nights sleep. THEN if hallucinations and delusions still exist talk to your MDS (movement disorder specialist).

You really should be keeping a log of everything and be seen on a regular basis by your MDS. 

If hallucinations and delusions started up the same time as movement issues, it might be a sign of Lewy Body Dementia. Once again that is a discussion between you, your caregiver, and your Movement Disorder Specialist.

For me I'm planning on hanging onto every moment as long, I can. Don't sweat the small stuff, and the end of the day it is all small stuff.

My father was diagnosed with PD around the age of 40 when I was 10-11 years old and has had the disease for over 15 years. It is extremely uncommon for a person to be diagnosed so young, as the average age of diagnosis is 62, and only 4% of people with PD are diagnosed before the age of 50.


Growing up, I always saw it as an embarrassment. I would pray every night that the disease would go away and things would be normal again. I used to think it was unfair for me to have a parent with PD. Everything was about me. As the years have passed, I'm left to wonder why it is fair for someone with still so many goals, ambitions and adventures to be diagnosed so young. It's frustrating beyond comprehension, even if my dad has made an effort to never show it when I'm around. Never once has he ever complained, no matter how bad things are. It is tough to watch a parent struggle at times with the most basic tasks that we take for granted on a daily basis.


Sometimes there really isn't much to do other than cry, and cry a lot.


Today, I realize just how ignorant I was back then, no matter how much pain my family has incurred. It is the single biggest blessing to be able to see life the way I do, and I wouldn't be who I am today without going through this.


Only recently did I start to talk about this, and it is still a rather uncomfortable subject for me. As I started opening up, a good friend of mine noted that stuff like this is the reason why he doesn't believe in God. After all, if there is a God, why would things like this happen? I give that question a lot of thought every single day. I don't know why bad things happen to good people. I don't know why the man crossing the street is blind, or why children are born with life-altering disabilities, or why homelessness and world hunger exist. It's kept me up many nights thinking about how some people have it so much harder than others. Life is frustratingly unfair like that, but I'd like to think it's so that we become more appreciative of what we have and in turn try to help out others who are less fortunate. I've come to realize that life is not about monetary possessions or traveling the world or watching your favourite sports team win a championship. It is about your impact on others, and how you are able to help those around you. It sucks that my father has PD. But if I am able to turn around and help even 2 people live a better life because of this, I'd like to think that it makes things a little easier to accept, and gives it a positive meaning.


This letter isn't about ""poor me"" or ""feel sorry for me"". So far, in my 26 years, I've been blessed beyond belief. Going through this only helped me develop the greatest appreciation of life itself. Instead, this letter signifies that it is time to get to work. I may be naive to think starting a website in my bedroom will make a difference. After all, I'm not a scientist, this isn’t a Hollywood movie, and not everything has a happy ending. But if I am able to raise even $5, we will be $5 closer to finding a cure. And every penny counts.


Or perhaps, you have been personally affected by another disease or illness and would like to contribute towards that cause instead after reading this. I understand that PD is not as immediately life-threatening as cancer, and does not affect as many individuals as other diseases. But PD is what I am affected by personally, and as a result is what I choose to fight against. The truth is, everyone has a story that will break your heart. It is important to use that as motivation to take action. Hope is simply not a strong enough strategy.


As Chuck Klosterman puts it, ""there is nothing scarier than thinking everything in life happens by chance."" I'm a fond believer that everything happens for a reason, and this is my purpose. I've grown up realizing that sometimes life isn't fair, and as much as it sucks, you can either complain for the rest of your life, or you can do something about it. Not everything that happens to me will be my fault, but everything certainly is and will always be my responsibility. I sincerely hope you will join me in the pursuit of a cure for Parkinson's Disease. My ultimate goal is to raise awareness about PD in the hopes that those who are currently affected by it are able to achieve a greater standard of living, and that eventually we will find a cure.


And if you currently suffer from PD, in the words of Jim Valvano, ""Don't give up, don't ever give up."" Keep fighting and continuing to be an inspiration to others. My father is easily my biggest hero. After all, there was and still is no explanation, no answers. And you're supposed to just accept it. You're supposed to live with it. He got cheated out of life itself, yet has never complained once. I don't think I will ever fully comprehend how much strength/courage that takes and the impact that has had on my life. And my mother couldn't exemplify the wedding vow ""in sickness and in health"" any more courageously. The love she shows for my dad is something that I admire and strive to replicate everyday towards others. I honestly couldn't have asked for better role models. Throughout my entire life, they’ve sacrificed their happiness in order to ensure I would never have to sacrifice mine, and now I spend every waking moment trying to pay them back. I wish I could give them the world. Again, I've been blessed beyond belief. 

 

In conclusion, I'd like to end with this quote:

""If something is important enough, even if the odds are against you, you should still do it."" - Elon Musk

 
Some people go through life never finding the one thing they're truly passionate about, whether it be a job, a person, an idea, a hobby, or a place. If you're ever lucky enough to find it, please pursue it with everything you've got, for all those who wish they did or still could. Finding a cure may take 5 years. It may take 25 years. Or it may even take 225 years. In fact, there's a chance we may never find a cure. But I'm only 26 and I will fight this thing for as long as I live. I've simply lost too much.

 

It is time to get to work, and to turn an unfortunate break into the biggest blessing of my life. #BeatParky

1440,Struggling with father's diagnosis and behavior,CosmicSerendipity,1,7kbp28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parkinsons/comments/7kbp28/struggling_with_fathers_diagnosis_and_behavior/,9,1513511246.0,"Hi all. Long-time lurker here. This is my first Reddit post ever, so please forgive me for the length of this. My (34, f) father (mid 50s) was recently diagnosed with Parkinson’s, and I’m struggling with not only his diagnosis but his behavior. On top of PD, he’s got fibromyalgia, spinal stenosis, depression, PTSD, and sarcoidosis. So, he’s been on a cocktail of medications for a few years now, but he’s just begun some of the heavier duty PD medications as of lately. 

In the past few weeks, he was put on a new medication (I’m not exactly sure which one), but it has severely affected his behavior (and not really helped his tremors). My mother has recently opened up to me about the side effects and they are really disturbing. He’s absolutely convinced that my mother is and has been cheating on him their whole (30+ years) marriage, which is completely outrageous. He’s accused her of having a boyfriend, posting nude photos online, etc. He calls her every thirty minutes if she’s not home with him to check on her and make sure she’s not with someone else. He’s told her that he’s now looking to meet other women and that he’s been going into sex chatrooms. He’s asked to have threesomes. He’s become increasingly aggressive, knocking over chairs and hitting walls. He’s told her that he knows this is going to kill him and he basically doesn’t care anymore. This is COMPLETELY out of character for my father. He’s always been a very gentle, reserved, quiet, and hard-working man. A few years ago, he had to retire early due to the stenosis and fibro and since then, everything has been downhill. Needless to say, this is completely breaking my mother who’s been his unwavering caregiver throughout all of the medical problems he’s experienced over the years. It’s a huge burden on her on top of working full time.

I’ve read a bit about the side effects of PD medications and I understand that delusions and psychosis are common, and I know that his doctors are trying to find a medication and dosage that will work for him, but in the meantime, this is ruining my family. My mother has been in touch with his doctors (neurological and psychological) about everything and is logging all of the things he’s saying and doing. This week they are meeting with all of his doctors to try to figure things out. They are also going to evaluate him for deep brain stimulation. But she’s told me several times that she doesn’t know how much longer she can take all of this. To make matters worse, my brother has been nothing but unsupportive and downright mean to my mother about all of this, calling her (and me) an enabler for letting the doctors put my father on various medications to help his medical issues. He’s trying to convince my father to leave my mother and go live with family out of state (they are not viable caregivers and have NO clue what my mother has been through). My mother has made it clear to me that if that happens, she’s done and will divorce.

Anyway, I guess what I’m wondering is how do I cope with this? I am beside myself about my father’s behavior and the fact that this is ruining their marriage. How can I help my mother deal? I’m struggling with being angry and feeling sorry for my father. On one hand, I know this is not him; it’s the medication making him act irrationally. But on the other hand, I’m angry about the things he’s doing and saying to my mother, and I’m angry that he seems to have just given up after this diagnosis. I have three young children, so I have my hands full on top of all of this, but I would like to help my mother and find a way to better cope with everything. Any words of wisdom or support are appreciated.",2017-12-17 11:47:26

1445,Seeking Advice - Parents resisting medical treatment,UninformativeNome,8,7jtpue,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parkinsons/comments/7jtpue/seeking_advice_parents_resisting_medical_treatment/,3,1513306362.0,"TLDR - My parents persistently resist advice for my mother's Parkinson's and I worry that it will negatively impact care moving forward. How do I help them? 

Full disclosure, I am a trained medical doctor and recognized that my mother, age 55, was having difficulty for the last few years. As I live out of state, I only saw part of the picture as my mother was concealing her symptoms: slow gait, stooped figure, frozen left hand, tremors, etc. 

Six months ago, my sister thought my mother had had a stroke. I pulled strings and got her into UCLA for full workup. My parents resisted going as they thought nothing was wrong and that her symptoms were normal aging. I flew back to LA and took her to see the doctor myself. It wasn't a stroke, symptoms were suspicious for Parkinsons (I should have known but I'm not a neurologist by training). 

My mother disagreed with the diagnosis and thought the doctor was a quack. She initially also refused to take any levodopa because she didn't need it (even though she admitted earlier that her symptoms had gotten so bad that she was afraid to drive). 

I finally convinced her to take the medication and she's very much had a honeymoon period with her meds. She is currently medically compliant. 

Now, even at age 55, she hasn't been very proactive with her disease management and has demonstrated a few concerning behaviors:

- Making up stories about Parkinson's that didn't make medical sense to me, e.g. telling me her doctor had given her permission to skip medication days, titrate doses as needed, etc. 
- Going to non-doctors who will tell her what she wants to hear, ""It's not Parkinson's it's just compressed nerves and it's totally curable."" 
- She very much believes that disease can be ""cured"" with diet and exercise. I've told her I'm very supportive of good diet and exercise, but I hold reservations about giving people false hope
- Sometimes we repeat the discussion about what Parkinson's is and what it means several times over the course of the last six months
- Procrastinating on setting up appointments for follow-up, even though I originally did pull some strings to get her in faster

She admits that the depression is so bad she is much more functional not thinking about the disease. To that end, she has

- refused to attend any support groups because she ""doesn't want to see crippled people.""
- refused to see a counselor about her emotional state even thought she admits she has frequent crying episodes, insomnia, feelings of hopelessness
- refused to do any learning herself about the disease as she finds reading about ""sick people"" to be too scary
- already told me that she would rather ""die from the disease"" that consider invasive measures like a DBS, if the disease got to that point
- no interest in participating in any clinical trials 

My father isn't much help either. He believes that much of this is part of the aging process. He isn't a very reliable person and  has struggled with a chronic gambling problem. 

I am already relocating my family back home to be closer to my parents to help out. My concern is, having seen some patients with Parkinson's, that the situation may go sideways before my parents realize the severity of the situation and want to act. 

It seems that my mother only wants to hear what she wants to hear and takes a very defensive, hostile tone when contradicted, but I fear this will be harmful in the long run. 

Does anyone have any advice on how I can help or what I should do? ",2017-12-15 02:52:42

Looking for gift ideas for my father. He was diagnosed with early onset Parkinsons when he was 45 and has had the disease for over 15 years. Now in his 60s, I’m not too sure what to get him. His mobility isn’t great and he can’t really do too much. 

I was thinking a heat pad/blanket and trekking poles. But I feel like these are so much related to PD that it doesn’t even feel like a gift. 

Hoping someone out there has some fun ideas or things that may really benefit his day-to-day life!

We are currently in need of participants to try out the tool and provide feedback. Individuals with and without PD are welcome to try it out. For a limited time, all those who run through the tool and finish the accompanying survey will receive a $50 gift card as compensation for their time and effort. The tool uses video analytics to identify and measure the symptoms of Parkinson's disease much like a neurologist would. Altogether, participation should take about 15 minutes. To take part, please follow the link. For any questions regarding the tool please email parktoolhelp@gmail.com or reply to this thread. All feedback is welcome.  

Edit: Not sure why the link wasn't working. I have included it below:

Additional Details:

The study involves opening the tool in a browser, agreeing to the E-consent form, and turning on your computer's webcam and microphone. The tool will then lead you through a series of recorded tasks. These tasks range from reading a short sentence to tapping your fingers together in view of the camera. After the tasks are complete you will fill out a short demographic survey. One of the questions on the survey will be to provide an email address. A $50 amazon e-gift card will be sent to that address following completion.

1462,Can stress cause or further progression of PD?,AvocadoIsAFruit,3,7g6xqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parkinsons/comments/7g6xqq/can_stress_cause_or_further_progression_of_pd/,2,1511927848.0,"Edit: **TLDR;** My father has PD. My mom thinks it's because he bottles up his emotions. We went on vacation with a lot of physical activity. He's gotten significantly worse. Have you experienced something similar? 

-------

My father was diagnosed with PD in 2014, he was 51 at the time. All my life (I'm 23) I haven't really seen my father all that angry or sad. He's a good dad, he takes on our family's burdens so that we don't have to worry as much. But he doesn't express those burdens or worries as normal people would. He doesn't get angry, he doesn't cry, he doesn't show his frustration or stress.

My mother thinks that because he bottles up his emotions, even if he has good intentions, it has caused a deficiency in his brain because he never had any release.

At first I didn't believe it as much. I didn't agree that it was the sole cause of his PD. We went to China this past summer, visited 8 cities in the span of 2 weeks. The heavy strain of walking miles on end from 8 am to 10 pm started taking a toll on his body. He started to lose his balance more and more. He couldn't lean forward to pick up a bag without nearly falling over. Nor could he stand up straight for longer than a minute without stumbling backwards. I noticed this quick progression towards the end of the trip, because before we left for China he was still walking around showing few symptoms that you wouldn't notice unless you looked closely. But on the trip, I found myself holding his hand everywhere we went so that I can hold on and catch him if anything were to happen. He was a champ though, he didn't back down from any challenge such as climbing the Great Wall.

Along with all of these other symptoms, his mild tremors began while we were there. I believed that it was solely due to the physical stress and that he should recover as soon as he got a week to rest after the trip. Unfortunately today, 4 months later, he still has tremors and his balance is god awful. He can't come to a full stop unless he leans into a wall. I regret going on vacation. I wish we never went. 

His doctor said a month after the trip that the symptoms were only due to the physical stress but doesn't have any direct correlation with how quickly he's progressing now. I don't believe her. Luckily she prescribed him medicine that seeks to be helping.

I know that it presents itself in many ways and my PD circle isn't to wide. 

But I (35yo/Early Onset) noticed changes in myself more from muscle rigidity starting closer to the spine and expanding outwards. Neck -> chest -> shoulder -> arm -> finger as an example of progression. 

I'm wandering if any others had similar progression from the midline of the body outwards and if that prolonged your diagnosis period due to ""no evidence of tremor"".

Finds fringe anecdotal fixes and ""cures"" online, goes to a Chiropractor who specializes in neurological disorders, etc.. How do others manage watching their loved ones make choices that do not help prolong quality of life?",-reTARDIS,7,7cnzzj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parkinsons/comments/7cnzzj/mother_with_pd_refuses_to_take_medication_see/,10,1510617468.0,"I am really upset right now. I realized I have started to avoid talking with or visiting my mother as she refuses to take her medication or see her actual primary doctor and neurologist. 

She spent $300 recently on some ""cold laser"" to fix/cure (she said there's YouTube videos about it!) her PD. Now she's going full Vegan as she read somewhere that it helps control/roll back PD and also said there's YouTube videos and documentaries about it! She went and found MJ as she does not understand that something that can help with the symptoms does not cure/regress the incurable disease she has.  

She read exercise is good (it is!) so she got an exercise bike, used it a few times, now it just sits unused. She says she's to sore to use it now (because she keeps falling down) so she just sits at her computer desk at her keyboard for 8+ hours a day and zero physical activity. 

She keeps chasing these ""cures"" and fixes she finds by who knows who online posting anecdotal at best and deception by design solutions that drain her of her very fixed income (she has not worked in over 10 years) and it's just killing me inside. She had signs of PD for the past 8+ years. It took me yelling at her and my Dad a year ago to FINALLY get her to see a REAL doctor, get the brain scans and confirm what she never wanted to confirm and I already knew, that she DOES have PD, it's not just a neck cramp that's pinching some nerve like she said for years and STILL tries to say is the real issue.  

She said she went to a chiropractor who specializes in neurological disorders (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!WTF!!!!!!!!!) and he said her ribs were ""out of socket!"" holy shit I wish I was making this up. And he ""popped"" them right back in and it sure did help her! I mean, great, I'm not against chiropractors in general but I am against one that is telling her he will help her PD by putting her ribs back into socket!

Since she REFUSES to see a REAL medical doctor and she's just getting worse what was the solution recently? She paid out of pocket to go to a lab place that will take blood and run different test and send you the results. She did this all out of pocket, without any involvement with a real doctor. I was afraid to ask but did ask ""what did you do with the results then?""... She emailed it to her chiropractor and he said ""your blood looks great, you're in great health!"" 

Every time I see her, I see she's a bit worse, she can't walk at all now without my Dad holding her arm. She used to do the foot shuffle a bit before, now she just slides her feet without being able to lift them. She cannot write by hand anymore, she refuses to use a cane and only sometimes uses hiking poles and keeps falling and hurting herself more often and more severely too. 

I just feel like throwing up anymore from a mixture of frustration at her absolute refusal to take the freaking medication the doctor put her on or do any of the prescribed physical therapy, and just chasing these empty hopes of random online findings that give her false hope, support her desire to ignore the facts and often waste her money. 

I watch her inability to do the most simple functions and I know, that's just part of PD, but knowing that she is not doing everything in her power to improve her quality of life as long as possible (while convincing herself that is exactly what she IS doing!) if not even for herself then at least for my Dad, for my kids, my brother and his kids, me! I just want to yell at her and hold her and cry! I feel alone in this..battle or struggle to find the right way to convince my Mom to do whatever she can to help herself. 

My brother lives in another state, he cares, we talk but he just doesn't SEE what I see. I feel guilty even discussing it with him anymore, he has his own issues to deal with and I want to just talk to my brother, my friend, for the fun of it sometimes. Every time I talk about it I have to face it too, I have to feel this that I'm feeling now instead of ignoring it, which is the only way to also live MY life, focus on my wife, my two wonderful kids, my career too. 

Its my Mom! The person that raised me, nurtured me, always told me to be open minded and to come to my own conclusions without others telling me what to think. I just never thought her lessons she taught me that made me do just that and always pursue fact over assumption and opinion led her down the complete opposite path that now makes her always assume if it's said to be the correct thing to do by a medical doctor or scientist then by default it means to her its a scam, a trick, a way to steal money and not about helping her. 

I don't know how to keep doing this... 

She's mad at me for not being supportive of becoming a full vegan 3 weeks ago to cure or help her PD. 

I am furious!!! at her for not doing ANYTHING at all that is proven, confirmed, scientifically backed, double-blind confirmed FACTUAL first! If she wants to be a vegan? Great! I have no issues with it even a little bit! I DO have an issue with her becoming a vegan INSTEAD of doing what she should REALLY do first! or at least in addition to all these other fringe ""fixes"" and empty promises that only support her way of thinking and ignoring facing the facts and reality of her disease. 

I don't know why I typed this out. I don't know what I am even asking of everyone. I just felt the need to write this, to sort my thoughts and emotions and feelings I'm struggling with today....

Have others gone through similar with their loved ones with PD? What came of it? What helped you? What helped your loved one? ",2017-11-13 23:57:48
1481,Possible area for future research of treatments for Parkinson's Disease?,StevanWhite,4,7c9nb6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parkinsons/comments/7c9nb6/possible_area_for_future_research_of_treatments/,14,1510449807.0,"I humbly ask those who are brilliant in the Reddit community to consider the following and please leave a reply in a constructive manner that is helpful to both other readers and myself. 

Disclaimer: 

I am not a Doctor or a Medical Professional. This post is speculation and not to be intended as medical advice and is solely posted for information purposes and with hopes that Real Scientists may look further into the matter.

In short, I believe that Parkinson's Disease has to with Epinephrine being mismanaged by the lack of an essential enzyme(s) that oxidizes it. 
I believe people with Parkinson's may be stuck in a sort of Adrenal loop which ultimately overwhelms the affected in time because the Adrenaline is not properly disposed of. A lot of the symptoms of Andrenaline release and those of Parkinson's appear similar.

While reading up on Parkinson's Disease I noticed that it referenced Mitochondria dysfunction as a condition of the Disease. I also read that MAO-B inhibitors are used in the treatment of Parkinson's Disease. 

The Monoamine Oxidase enzymes are located in the outer layer of the Mitochrondria. One of the roles of one of the  MAO enzymes is to facilitate the breakdown of Epinephrine (via oxidization by MAO). When reading about Epinephrine release (adrenaline) and it's side effects, I realized that these oddly paired to side effects of Parkinson's Disease. The one paired symptom of both that really raised an eyebrow was the dilated pupils, irregular heartbeat and rapid pulse.

Another point of interest is the fact that Parkinson's Disease is believed to be the result of brain injuries and oxygen deprivation. When a person is deprived of oxygen their adrenal glands release Epinephrine. 

So the theory is that people who suffer from Parkinson's Disease may have their symptoms due to lack of Epinephrine oxidization because of the Mitochondria outer layer which houses the enzyme that oxidizes Epinephrine is damaged.

I found an article online with a research paper that said the Following: 

""The polyphenol oxidase enzymes present in the fibers of a palm tree fruits (Livistona chinensis), catalyses the oxidation of epinephrine to epinephrinequinone as a primary product."" credit: Fabiana S.Felix, Miyuki Yamashita, Lúcio Angnes

So this plant 'Chinese Fan Palm'    (Livistona chinensis) has fruit fibers which contain an enzyme that has the ability to oxidize Epinephrine. 

Another interesting fact is that 
Nilotinib is being tested for efficacy against Parkinson's Disease and I believe the article said it shows great promise. What is peculiar about this - besides the hope of its efficacy - is the fact that Nilotinib is a Tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Tyrosine is an amino acid that is one of the essential components of producing Epinephrine. So if I am correct this means Nilotinib inhibits Tyrosine which means Epinephrine is not produced?
 

Once again, I am not a doctor or a medical professional. I am just a hobby researcher and put together an unprofessional thesis for possible treatment so please consider this for research and I hope this helps.

They have not gone away at all during the entire time. I've been having muscle spasms all throughout my body at random, but very often. The same kind of spasm people commonly get in their eyelid pretty commonly. But it happens to muscles all over my body at random every few minutes, sometimes more frequently. My muscles seem to be tired a lot, if I hold my arm up for just a small period of time, even less than 30 seconds, I feel like I've been holding it up for 10 minutes. I have been experiencing shaking in my hands but I'm not sure if that's ""shaking"" or ""tremor"" because my doctor still hasn't explained to me what the difference, if any would be. My hands aren't flying everywhere but they are noticeably shaky when I hold then up. If my hand is on my laptop keyboard and I lift any of my fingers up, they tremble and shake. I haven't really had any resting shaking until recently, but I'm not sure if that's because of how stressed out I am about this. I have had plenty of muscle spasms in my fingers while my hand was at complete rest, so bad that one time my middle finger was vibrating violently like it was an engine. That doesn't happen often, but it most commonly happens in my thumbs, I can feel like, I guess it feels like a current of electricity going through my hand/finger. Most of the time when I feel this, nothing visual happens, but sometimes when I feel it, my finger twitches. I've been so worried that I may have early signs of Parkinsons but no one is helping me or giving me any real information. I've been to a neurologist but she was kind of flaky, and said that nothing I'm dealing with sounds like Parkinsons, which is funny, because it sounds exactly like it to me. Any ideas?

Drugs I had yet to realize were contaminated. I used them to cope with my depression and the fact that I had nothing to live for. I quit and flushed them when I was self-checked into an ER for Methanol overexposure that damaged my sight but did not blind me. My kidneys seem fine from the few urine tests I've had, but my brain... I now have what feels like a persistent, sometimes oscillating cramp behind my right kneecap. I occasionally feel tremors on other parts of my body too. My ability to pay attention to things went down a bit but it isn't yet interfering with my actual life. 

I'm absolutely terrified and I just don't know what to do first. I've been a recluse practically my entire life. I thought that this would be the year that I finally turn things around, having found the motivation to start losing weight and take up new hobbies. The year I pick up a real job that doesn't involve being a psuedo-caretaker to my bipolar father. But now, I can't get rid of the feeling that my life is over before it even began. I cry every day, I have to excuse myself from my classes and cry in the bathroom. 

All I've ever truly wanted was to raise kids of my own. To be a better parent than my parents were to me. I feel like there's no hope at all of even that. Who's to say I'll even be able to work in a few years? I'm scared and terrified and nothing eases the tremor. I haven't gone to the neurologist yet because my symptoms are extremely recent. I'm also broke (though I do have insurance through my mother), so I don't even know if I could afford medications. And outside of my mother, who I have yet to tell *any* of this, the family I have simply cannot support me when things get worse. 

I want to live so badly but I don't want to be a burden and feel my very ability to interact with the world at large literally rot away. I just want to live the life I never got to live while I still can. What hope is there for me? How can I tell my mother about this? ",2017-10-11 21:59:52

I am seeing one, and I have several symptoms that my neurologist is treating as separate but worry me because they could all be Parkinson's. I'm just looking to see if anyone else has similar symptoms for early onset and their experience getting diagnosed in general (how long it took, what tests were done).

I've seen a neurologist for two years first for chronic migraines. In January my health got worse for a while, while I tried to get my insurance from a new job to approve Botox. I finally get Botox for the second time ever in April and I started to notice that independent of migraines, I stared to get severe hand cramps. ""The claw"". I'd thought they were part of my migraines for a while as there is a subtype of migraine that strikes the basal ganglia. Aphasia, pain, fatigue accompany it.

Anyways, it progresses. It starts to sap me of energy. I finally end up in the ER when it seems to strike my foot, my speech slurs at epic new levels and I panic that I'm having a stroke. False alarm, have a 3k ER bill for a CAT scan and Benadryl through IV. FML.

I go see the neurologist in July, and I finally have a bad attack in the office and he takes me seriously. Says it's dystonia. He thinks it's task related but it happens to both sides of my body, switching off. Sends me for a basic MRI, it's clean.

Also over the summer, my toddler breaks my damn nose in June. I have ridiculous unexplained pain from it, with an ENT clearing me of any normal explanation for the pain.

Six weeks ago, metal mouth appears.

I started carb dopa Friday. Yesterday (Saturday) I had the stamina to start a load a dishes for the first time in months. No facial pain, no metal mouth, no dystonia. 

I know dystonia can be caused by other things, that's it's also closely related to dopamine and all my symptoms could be independent of each other. I know, but I'm finding it hard to believe that carb dopa just fixes all of it over night. Some sites say the most common tool for diagnosing Parkinson's is just levodopa controlling symptoms. I just don't have tremor (much) and I'm 32 so I'm worried my neurologist might just be missing it. Is there other tests used commonly that helped anyone with early onset getting diagnosed? 

Anyways. Thanks for reading. ",2017-09-25 00:53:03

About 5 months ago I went to see a neurologist and told her my symptoms and fear of having early onset Parkinson's disease.

She quickly dismissed it because of my age and said it was most likely essential tremors. I went away happy thinking it was no big deal. And for about a month or two it went away.
Monday of this week it started twitching again only this time it went on ALL day. It would stop briefly and then keep doing it. It's a side to side twitch and it really freaks me out. The twitch itself is painless but it still gives me a lot of anxiety. From Monday to today it's been twitching all day everyday and I'm about to set up another appointment with a neurologist today but in the mean time I was wondering if anyone can tell me what may be going on? I'm really scared and can't stop thinking about what the future holds for me if I do indeed have Parkinson's.

Gambling, bordem and lonliness.",ukfella2k17,5,6yqk9o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parkinsons/comments/6yqk9o/please_help_25_yo_student_with_mum_with_pd_uk/,6,1504851297.0,"My mum has PD and has recently been gambling an awful lot of money, money which she should be using to pay her bills. She has been frequently asking me to buy her shopping and food and also lend her money. I have given her hundreds over the last few months. I worry when she has no food as she cannot take her medication without eating and she also seems to be loosing weight. 

I am a 25 year old male student who lives 5 minutes away from  my mum and Uni starts up again in a week or two. Whilst I'll be staying at home I wont have the time to help my mum as much as I'd like as I'll also be having to find a job to support myself. I cannot claim carers allowance as a full time student unfortunatley but this does not change the fact that as an only child I'm the only one there to help.

We spoke to my mums nurse about the issue to which my mum became very upset and she also has massive anger outbursts and has also on several ocassions taken the keys from me for the motability car we use to get her around to her appointments and shopping etc. She uses the car as a tool of power almost, even calling the police once to have it taken from me which was unbelievable. She later regrets this and gives me access again. I paid £1000 for the car deposit also so this can be quite a daunting situation. 


Anyway I recently opened a new bank account for my mum to which she didn't have access and worked out exactly what she had spare per week to spend on food and whatever she liked. The agreement was that I would sort out all of her bills from the main account from which she is locked out of and send her weekly spare money to the new account which I do not have access too.

Upon attempting this the first week my mum managed to snatch the new card from me and gamble nearly £300 within an hour of having the card and also phoned the bank and used the details on the card and her convincing manner to lock me out.

My mums nurse says it may be a medication causing the issues and they are looking to lower the dose now. 

Is it actually possible though for such a severe gambling addiction to begin after my mum being on the same medication for 5 years now?

The new plan now is to restart the bank plan with a new card and bank log in details the next time she is paid. My mum has racked up a lot of debt due to this problem. Some of which she cannot afford to pay off.

Is there any software anyone knows of to block these gambling sites? I fear it may send my mum into one of her anger rampages in which she can be very nasty and do horrible things such as ring colleagues and my college for example making up horrible stories about me but it may need to be done. It's a horrible situation as I feel my mum is just very lonely and bored and no long feels able to leave the house alone so gambling became a hobby of sorts. 

I guess my three main concerns are, firstly, as previously mentioned..

1. Could medication of 5 years suddenly cause a gambling addiction?

2. Is there a well known way to block these online gambling websites?

3. Is there anywhere I could find a list of possible hobbies or something that my mum might enjoy doing?

Thank you in advice for any help and I wish everyone here the best of health and happiness.

Up till about last February he had issues with shaking and the normal woes of the diesease yet you could still have functional conversations with him and he could go about life as normal as one can. Since then he has gone through some chances. Considerable stress (moving due to flooding, divorce, etc.) and there have been numerous doctors he's seen that have been trying new medications and dosages. Since then he has not been the same person. As soon as the medication begins to wear off my dad will begin to freeze up and get panic attacks. He is living with his parents currently until his new place is ready and I am off at school. He barely sleeps, and becomes delusional at night, claiming people are trying to put him into a psychiatric hospital and that someone is trying to hurt him. There was one instance where began walking about the house and began to lose balance near some nice pieces of art. Luckily I was there to hold him up and help ease him onto the ground until he regained balance. He cried out ""my son is trying to have me fall and break your artwork"" to his parents when all I was trying to do was help. He has become the horniest person I know, often says things that don't make sense, and is unable to do the smallest tasks. I don't know if he has terrible short term memory is just simply complacent. I will ask him to do something (i.e. call his accountant and make sure I have money for college) and he will say yes but simply won't do it. I think he responds knowing full well he'll just stay in bed and do nothing about it. Last year and the year before that he had two instances where he accidentally took far more medication than intended and wound up in the hospital with similar symptoms. I don't necessarily think his parents are giving him the best care as they are very stubborn and set in their ways. I think his brain fog has reached a maximum and he is unable to think clearly about anything. Any time something stressful is brought yet needs to be discussed he will begin shaking and start stiffening up, calling out for his parents. This creates a situation where nothing can get through to him about his current situation. I How do his symptoms compare to that of others? Is any of this anything of normal considering the circumstances or is there something amiss here as I'm starting to believe. ",2017-08-25 01:04:35

So few years ago, my Dad was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease. He has tried a few different methods of curing it but he is currently on some medication.

He took some medication that made him be impulsive and pursue desires. He initially got into photography and bought a bunch of expensive equipment. But the real problems started when he started posting these pictures on his google+ account. 

He started getting contacted by a bunch of different African people. From what Dad tells me, they all spend time talking to him and befriending him. Eventually after a few days, weeks or months, they would ask for money because 'somebody is hospitalised' or an 'investment opportunity' pops up. Dad is a smart guy, he is an IT expert, but he got completely into these investments and stories and insisted that it was legit. He ended up giving away more than $40 000 dollars or at least that's how much is missing. One lady asked for $400 because she broke her leg and couldn't work. Mum has been trying to change bank security details but Dad has control through the internet. 

When the doctor specialist heard about it, she sent my Dad to the hospital and had him locked away from all technology until the meds wore off. He woke up and admitted what he was doing was a bit silly. 

Now, two years later, he is on different meds but the problems have started to happen again these past few months. He is adamant that he is investing in some gold that will be shipped to him, all that is required is $10 000. He did this without telling my Mum. The doctor he used to have has changed and she says that he needs to see a psychologist because the issue isn't part of her field. 

I currently live in a different city to my immediate family. I recently went back to visit and learned about all of this happening again. Me being the oldest sibling, confronted Dad and it got ugly. He couldn't give me any straight answers to my questions. I told him that he is risking his family leaving by doing this. He argued with 'I am doing this for the family, I want to live a little before I die, you are all over thinking this'. Rubbish.

I got a phone call from my Mum today. My brother snapped and punched a wall. I realised there is no sense talking to Dad anymore. He can't be talked out of this. 

I'm sorry for the long post, it turned into a bit of a rant. I was wondering if anyone has any experiences like this and if they managed to overcome it some how? I'll be happy to take any sort of advice. I live in Australia. 

We love Dad. We know this isn't him. But there's only so much we can do. Mum has already threatened to divorce him and he couldn't care less. 

Please help.",2017-08-23 22:22:29

Sigh, 13000 hours of data for the Micheal J Fox foundation study, wanted to see a pre and post DBS activity levels on that data. I cut way down on medication, but most of my weight loss was pre DBS. Post DBS is typical to gain weight, but still not 100% clear on the relationship.


Bought a Garmin Vivoactive HR watch. They recently dropped from $249.99 to $200 ($180 street price).
Has the Pebble Notification Features I like, but still working on it. Having the Heart Rate (HR) rate monitor is good. It does display “calories burned” which started me down the question of how accurate is that as my son (an extremely active 6’ 160 pound super lean cyclist) thought the numbers were too  high.  

Just how many calories do I burn in a day?


https://www.healthstatus.com/calculate/basal-metabolic-rate


Example

Male

60 (sigh, getting there)

240

6’3”

Sedentary – 2508 calories

Moderate Activity – 3239 

Extremely Active - 3791

Why this is so interesting is when I weighed in at 300 pounds with moderate activity – you need 3813 calories without any weight change.  So as we lose weight, but keep same level of activity, we need fewer calories to maintain the same weight.


Looking at a target of 200 pounds means at moderate activity I need to target 2857 Calories. Yes, almost 400 less than I am consuming today to keep losing weight.


Eating healthy means cutting out sugar, no soda. Water, Black Coffee, limited alcohol. Bread and Pasta really pack in the carbs, which translates into sugar. Something for those type II diabetics to really look out for.


So quick glance:

It looks like HR is playing a large role in Calories burned, as the dog rescue day (Emergency Transport to pick up a 12 week old puppy with a colon blockage, local group will euthanize the pup as surgery is too expensive. When it comes to Golden Retrievers we have a fanatic fan base who will authorize any surrendered Golden Retriever will get medical care, hence time was critical for transport and my heart was racing the whole day. Catch was the family waited seven days to surrender, so very critical).

Very Quiet Day: 1200 steps 2457 Calories

Good Day 6740 steps 3467 Calories

Active walking 8717  steps 3106 calories

Very Active walking & Boxing day 12300 steps 4360 calories 

Road Trip (dog rescue) Good Day 7600 steps  3719 calories.  

Just interesting thoughts for this morning, while waiting on the word from the surgical team. 

edit: formatting. Due to sinemet, funny to realize how my fingers tell me ""medication is worn off"" Not as bad since I had DBS,
but just that one 25/100 every four hours still makes a difference. Prior to DBS, I wouldn't have been able to type this when off.

I don't know much about Parkinson's disease at all so please forgive me.  

Tonight I visited my grandma who was diagnosed with Parkinson's in 2013 and I won't go into it but she took a mocking tone towards me and I was shocked! 
I don't know how to feel. I am angry about it but I don't know if it's fair to be angry at her for it. It seemed as though she was being genuinely cruel and it hurt me deeply so I left (other family were there) and right now I am not sure if I can bring myself to go back. (I've gone through a lot of abuse and I'm at the point in my life where I can choose not to take it by leaving)  

As I said, I don't know much about Parkinson's so I wonder if she will remember doing this and is she going to act like this often? She has never mocked me before now.  
I love her very much and I want to continue to be a part of her life. I just feel I need to know more about what to expect.

My father-in-law has Parkinson's and is also diabetic. I'm not sure if his diet is ideal for his joined conditions. We recently read that if potassium and protein are ingested around the times of his Parkinson's medications, the medications might not work as well. He's losing weight steadily so we would like to keep his protein levels higher vs lower.  He does eat very well, no fast food, lots of fresh, whole ingredients.  Gets told to PUT THE SALT DOWN every meal. My mother-in-law can really cook!  
I know this is something to discuss with a dietitian but I was wondering if you all have any insight or links to articles that explain it all a little more.  Maybe macro nutrient ratio guidelines?

The bonus was I get a free 2 hour auditory exam (this was for the Masters of Audiology programme). Apart from tinnitus which I have experienced for 25 years, I had no expectations that anything was wrong with my hearing.

Well I got one helluva shock when they told me that I was moderately to severely impaired at mid to high frequencies in both ears, my left side a bit worse. I have been dx with PD for 8.5yrs, and am age 43. Apart from listening to music too loud as a kid (who didn't), I have never had a job which exposed me to long term noise, at least not loud enough to do damage.

I have had a look at some medical journals and apparently there is some relationship between Parkinson's and hearing loss: ""It is feasible that the natural aging process combined with neurodegenerative changes intrinsic to Parkinson's disease might interfere with cochlear transduction mechanisms"". Which makes sense, my left ear is the most impaired, as is the left side of my body.

Questions. So many questions. But let's start with two:

Has anyone else suffered this?

I have had DBS. Has anyone found that the DBS and hearing aids (hearing loss due to PD or otherwise) works ok or is there interference?",2017-07-29 17:45:30

About two months ago I posted that I was interested in getting my open water PADI certification, but was curious about how it would go given I have PD. 

For those of you wondering, turns out, it went great! I had an absolute blast, though some of the exercises were a challenge. Anything involving dexterity with my left arm was a pain, and took a little finessing, but as none of the requirements are timed, I was fine. I think the most difficult one was having to take off the Buoyancy Control Device (the inflatable life jacket looking bit) and putting it back on. I needed help out of the water, and reaching my arm back around and getting it into the BCD was a struggle in the water. Also,nursing to remove the mask and put it back on under water was terrifying, mostly because I had to wear contacts, so I had to keep my eyes shut tight while exposed to the water, which caused me some anxiety, which in turn increased the severity of my tremor, making it harder to get the mask back on properly. But with a few tries and some calm, deep breaths I proudly opened my eyes to see the instructor reaching out for a congratulatory fist-bump. 

Thankfully, the whole time I had a great buddy with me, my brother. He helped with anything I was struggling with getting into or out of the water, and as diving is all about looking after your fellow drivers it was fine. Plus, the staff were great. As usual, there was a little reluctance to mention it, even after I was upfront about it and made a few jokes myself, but after the first day in open waters, one of them asked about how it went given my PD, and what he could modify to help while teaching others with PD, and once we got chatting about that, it was no big deal again. 

I now have my open water certification, as well as my dry suit license, so I'm looking forward to more does soon! One step closer to my dream of diving in Iceland! ",2017-07-29 14:26:52

My grandmother is in her seventies, and is in bad shape. She was diagnosed with Parkinson's about three years ago, but has taken a major turn for the worse since my grandfather died. She is currently in the hospital undergoing a ton of tests. 

Her biggest problem right now is gastroparesis. She is in intense pain when she eats anything. When they weighed her at the ER this morning, she was down to 89 pounds from being unable to eat :( That puts her down 13 lbs since March. 

My mother has been harassing her doctors trying to get help, but they've been useless. They mostly prescribe laxatives and tell her to drink ensure. Even that is too hard for her sometimes. Mom finally took her to OSU's ER at their request today, to try to switch providers faster. My grandmother is absolutely miserable... if you know of any tips or therapies, ideas would be appreciated. She's done erythromycin and probiotics, and another medication whose name I can't remember. 

I absolutely believe Parkinson's has an environmental component. My grandfather died of LBD, and their symptoms began around the same time. They lived next to a commercial farm and drank well water for nearly fifty years.

So as some of you know, my father has PD, and has been diagnosed with it for about 17 years. Today I got a call from his friend that he has gone down hill VERY fast, and is showing signs of extreme dementia. 

I did just see him about a month ago, and he was showing some memory issues, but nothing as bad as he is now. In fact it is so bad that I am flying out to see him tomorrow to see what the next steps are in his care. He did have a very bad case of this last time he was in the hospital, which was several years ago, but bounced back.

I know he did go to his neuro recently and he's upped his meds (levadopa and sinimet, I think) could this be causing his cognitive issues?  Any suggestions? Thanks!",2017-05-26 06:16:38

Over the past few years, he has started using a walker/ a wheelchair, and it is very hard for him to get places because he feels that he is losing control over his body. Mentally, I think he is very depressed. He does not like to go out very much except to eat a weekly lunch with his best friend. He spends most of the day watching TV, and frequently makes comments like ""I wish I could just go to heaven."" I think finding him a hobby could help. Does anyone have any ideas for an easy hobby he could get into? He used to like film-making, but I don't think he can hold up a camera for long periods of time anymore. Before, he loved to sing, bake, and take pictures, but all that has stopped because he gets too tired or gets frustrated when he can't finish a task.

This spring has been a happy one, as I got as much physical coordination back as could possibly get back. However, mentally I'm glitching like mad, losing track of time (and what time is) coming out of fugue on public transportation and having no idea why I'm out or where I'm going... New Rule: No getting off the bus just because I can't remember why I'm on the bus!

I'm fairly certain that the worst of my neuro problems are due to the high level of stress I'm undergoing -- how many Parkies have to deal with the people around them gaslighting and bullying them? Its dangerous to drag a wing in this society, that's for damn sure. So much for background!

I have some specific questions, but I'd appreciate any information you can share.

* Do you prefer indicas, sativas, or hybrids?
* Do you look for specific strains or terpenes?
* What symptoms respond well to cannabis?
* How do you consume cannabis? Smoking, vaping, edibles, tinctures, topicals, etc? 
* What doses are most effective for you? How did you figure that out?

Furthermore, α-syn/Aβ aggregates were significantly reduced in athletes and inversely correlated with physical activity level, independent of age. The positive correlation between antioxidant capability/physical activity and reduced protein accumulation was confirmed by these data and suggested that peripheral α-syn heterocomplexes may represent new indicators of ND-related protein misfolding.

I watched him struggle as tremors and dexterity worsened. Eventually, common tasks like buttoning a shirt became impossible without help. And walking evolved into a slow, painful, awkward experience. But I never heard him complain. To the contrary, he maintained an incredible sense of humor, dignity, and grace notwithstanding the inelegant demise the disease suffered upon him during his latter years.

Nine years ago I began to notice an occasional, odd tingling in my left hand. Over time the tingling became more sustained before changing into full-fledged tremors. Finally, I visited a neurologist (when I was fifty-eight years old - I'm sixty-four now). I still vividly remember sitting in stunned disbelief when she said I had Parkinson's. (Trivia question - the average age of diagnosis has fallen from 72 to 58 over the last couple of decades. Why?)

For medical geeks out there who may be interested in the pathology involved, Parkinson's is caused by an irreversible loss of certain dopamine producing brain cells called neurons. By the time symptoms appear, 80% of the brain cells have already died. Notwithstanding lots of promising research with things like stem cells and deep brain stimulation, the disease remains incurable.

Adding insult to injury, about a third of all Parkinson's patients develop dementia.

Symptoms (tremors) can be moderated through a therapy of dopamine drugs for a while but eventually they lose effectiveness as the disease progresses. Forty years ago my grandfather took the exact same drug I currently take. Not a lot of progress in that regard.

And Parkinson's is an equal opportunity disease, affecting more than ten million people of all walks of life around the world. About a million of those people live in the U.S.

Most people know at least one person personally who has dealt with the disease.

Some of the notables who have suffered (or currently suffer) from Parkinson's include Pope John Paul II, Johnny Cash, Robin Williams, Linda Ronstadt, Muhammad Ali, Billie Graham, George H. W. Bush, Salvador Dali, Janet Reno, Sir Michael Redgrave, Vincent Price, and Michael J. Fox. The latter, of course, has courageously dealt with Parkinson's for more than a quarter of a century. He has also led the charge in raising Parkinson's awareness through the Michael J. Fox Foundation.

In my typical long winded way, I have finally reached the point of this essay.

In response to my diagnosis, I have taken up writing as therapy. (I'm even learning to use speech recognition software to type!)   

Last year I wrote a short story about a soldier’s struggle with Parkinson’s entitled Morning Chemical Assault (http://www.crfenergy.com/morning-chemical-assault.html ).

I wish each of you the best in your own Parkinson's journey, whether as a patient, caregiver, or in any other capacity.

Thanks,

Your shaky friend,

Sometimes I'm taking a walk and my leg doesn't ""fire"" when it should, but I always catch myself and it's never enough to make me fall.

 Anyway, here's exactly what I do EVERY DAY and, in the past year, my symptoms have improved to being almost imperceptible. If you try this, please post the results.

Morning:
- Start the day with 1/2 hour of aerobic exercise. For me this is a brisk walk to the gym, 15 minutes on an exercise bike, then brisk walk home.
-Two tablets of Coconut oil (or a tablespoon in oatmeal)
-Two tablets of Turmeric with some pepper (important)
With Lunch:
-Two tablets of Coconut oil (or a tablespoon in oatmeal)
-Two tablets of Turmeric with some pepper (important)
With Dinner:
-Two tablets of Coconut oil (or a tablespoon in oatmeal)
-Two tablets of Turmeric with some pepper (important)
Bedtime:
-Two tablets of Coconut oil (or a tablespoon in oatmeal)
-Two tablets of Turmeric with some pepper (important)
Once a week 
-acupuncture: be honest with the acupuncturist and tell him your symptoms. For me it's pain, balance and tremors. Works wonders.

That's essentially it. If you don't want to take tablets, make a tea out of turmeric root:peel a thumb size piece, slice, boil for a few minutes in a small amount of water (enough for a cup or two), add honey and lemon. Or, make a strong, yellow curry w/coconut oil.
This honestly stops all my symptoms for the day. Please post your results.
Note: Since this worked so well, I also added Amino acids to combat fatigue (works for me) and also Vitamin B-1.
To reiterate, i do a version of this routine EVERY DAY. If I skip a day, the symptoms come back.
Good Luck!

My sister was diagnosed four years ago with PD.  She is now 43yr.  She was in special education her entire schooling, but has had a job ever since graduating HS and also has had a boyfriend for the last 18 or so years.

In the last four months, her mental health has deteriorated.  She is paranoid, easily upset, and delusional in what she can and cannot do.
She thinks she can go from a job where she fills cabinets with food at the hospital to going back to school to be retrained.  She had at one time been promoted to managing others at her work (been there over 20yrs), but that didn't last as she was incompetent, plainly said.

She has become slower, physically, and often forgets to take her medication.  She forgets to pay bills.  She hasn't worked steadily in the last four months.  They keep putting her on family leave because she is so slow at her work she racks up OT so they make her take time off, for weeks at a time.  The last time she went back to work was near the end of January and she lasted two weeks, tops.  She kept coming in to work super late because she can't assess her time properly.

She refuses to stop working and get SSI, which I can't blame her in a way, as her work has been the one thing that makes her feel important.
Her boyfriend has become extremely frustrated with her.  They have been together for a very long time, and yet have never lived together.  My sister has always lived with my mom.

Her boyfriend finally cracked a few weeks ago and sobbed like a baby in front of her and promised he would start going with her to dr appointments so he can help out and probably so he can feel less out of control seeing what is happening to my sister.

My mom isn't dealing with her very well, either, but I can't blame her.  She is 79 yrs old, is a widow for the last 15 yrs and still lives in the house I grew up in, which is full of stairs.  I want them to move into a ranch house, so my mom at least has that worry gone, but it's tough getting her to make the move.

My mom has a house in Florida, that is a ranch, where she and my sister could go to live (she inherited it from my grandma).  In fact, she goes down there during the winter for several weeks and is there now for six weeks.  Since my mom left in Feb, my sister is all alone in the big house, and refuses my help.  I went to check up on her, and the key that was left for me from my mom was out of the planter - my sister took it out.  I couldn't gt into the house, and told my sister, who was talking to me through the door, that I would call the police if she didn't let me in so I could see how things were.  Not only would she not let me in, SHE called the police and baracaded the door.  The police showed up, and she still wouldn't open up the door unless I left the property.  The police finally convinced her I would stay on the driveway while they talked to her.

I left without seeing her, and haven't spoken to her since.  If she doesn't want my help I am not going to fight her.
She has spoken with my mom over the phone and has told my mom that people are watching her.  She thinks our long-term neighbor is watching her from the front lawn (our houses sit on 1/2 acre properties).  She says others are watching her.  She even went to the WRONG police station to see what they would do about people watching her.  It wasn't even the town where our mailing address is.  We live in an unincorporated subdivision, and need the county police, not ones from the local town.  She wants to get a burglar system set up at the house, and the area is one of the safest in all of the area.  NOTHING happens there.

I would like to have my sister live in some group home or something, but not sure how that would work since she is mentally and physically disabled.  Anyone have any options to give?  ",2017-03-20 01:44:48

He has some mobility issues (mainly reaction times) and is going to PT for that. Cognitively he is doing pretty well, except for when it comes to cause/effect historical facts. He meanders his train of thought to come up with a summary of 9/11, and when his neurologist asked him about Pearl Harbor he was only able to answer questions if they were more broken down. For instance, the Doctor originally asked him ""what can you tell me about Pearl Harbor"" and my dad's response was ""I think it's near Hawaii."" Then the doctor asked him what happened and he answered ""I think there was a bombing and a lot of ships sank."" And his answer to the significance of the even was similar ""I think that we went to war.""

I'm wondering if anyone has suggestions for apps (or anything else)  that may help stimulate his mind? His diagnosis was initially late coming because we all just thought he was getting quieter and non-active because he was bored in retirement. On his good days now that he is on meds he is a bit more social, but I don't want to push him when he is having a bad day.",2017-03-19 07:00:12

First, I took a vacation a few hours from home recently. About 1.5 hours into the trip, I notice I am having trouble concentrating on the road. I'm not distracted, just like unable to concentrate. Stopped at a rest stop, got a large coke and after drinking about half and 15 minutes, the feeling goes away and I am concentrating fine. Same thing happened on the way home. Less than 2 years ago, I drove from Ohio to Florida and back a week later, no problem.

Second, last summer, I was on a suspension bridge. Only about 30 meters, but had a lot of movement. I immediately had trouble. I froze for a few seconds, then moved very slow. It was like my feet could not tell where the ground was. The give probably only moved the floor a centimeter or two. Someone else enter the bridge from the other end to help and I completely froze. I needed them to back off of the bridge before I could start moving again. It was like my brain could not compute the two movements. After I was off of the bridge, for the next 20 or so steps, I had the same issue. It was like my legs could not compute the distance to the ground. Then it went away, and did not return.

I have been suffering with some cardiac issues for some time and whenever i go to the docs anything i say gets kinda ignored and they just want to talk about my ongoing cardiac problems (high blood pressure which randomly drops causing collapse, hight pulse and some hypertrophy).

I was diagnosed with essential tremmor at 22 but is was never all that bad, just an annoyance. I have now noticed the tremor is at rest, mainly in my right hand and thumb and a little in my head. My sense of smell has been deminishing gradually (the doc said this was because im a smoker). I have suffered with depression for a couple years but over the last few minths i have been having trouble getting to sleep and when i do i have terrible nightmares (this was put down to the depression). My back and neck are really stiff and ache constantly (doc said this was just bad posture).  i sweat constantly, even when its cold, and have started getting my words in a muddle when speaking and choking on my saliva alot.

I have asked the doctor about all these symptoms and as you can see he had an explanation for everything. Its not that  i dint trust him, im a paramedic myself and really trust doctors, but I would like to be seen by a neurologist as the symptoms seem to fit, even just for a piece of mind, but my doc said that its so rare and he can explain each symptom that there is no point and just gets back to the cardiac issues.

I don't know whether to see a new doc or to just crack on as i am. I dont want to seem like i am a hyperchondriac and put unnecessary strain in the NHS but i am concerned. The tremor is no longer controled by my beta blockers and is affecting my job as a paramedic. Any ideas reddit?",2017-02-19 21:01:47

I'm new to this community, so I'll try to give you a quick synopsis. I live with my grandfather who is in his late 70s and has been living with Parkinsons for almost a decade now. His symptoms have been well managed with medications up until very recently. His mobility is declining (he can still walk and get around, but it's very hard and painful for him. he does exercise daily on a stationary bike and tries to walk down the driveway for the paper every day), he's starting to hallucinate (he was on opiate pain killers for a very brief time, but was taken off for severe, terrifying hallucinations. the hallucinations have returned without the pain meds, which I understand is a common side effect of the disease). My grandfather is a proud man (he worked for GM, the Allison Project, and NASA as a field engineer [he helped fabricate the life support system on the lunar module on Apollo 13]) and hates to ask for help, but he is desperate for relief from his symptoms. I suggested medical marijuana, as its legal in Massachusetts now, and he's all for it. I'm looking to find CBD oils or edibles for him, I dont think he would enjoy smoking it, honestly. I'm aware of certain foundations in other states/countries that donate leaf and oils for those in need. I just wanted to reach out to you guys for information about medical marijuana in general, these alleged organizations, personal stories or anything really. Thank you for reading this!

I haven't posted here, but figured it was worth a shot. 

Long story short, my father was recently diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, and it's apparently very aggressive. He sent me a note today, basically saying he can't use his iPhone 4s anymore because he can't accurately key in numbers/letters etc. He was wanting to upgrade to an iPhone 7, but the keypad doesn't appear to be measurably larger, and I question how much improvement he'd get to fork over ~1k for a phone that's only marginally bigger. 

That said, I was thinking about getting him a smaller Android tablet that can also make calls; something in the 8"" range? I figure that would still be portable, but with it being android (and thus more open source), I could probably install some kind of ""large key"" app for his dial pad and text keypad. 

Does anyone know of a tablet that is capable of being used as a cell phone with AT&T? It doesn't need to be anything terribly fancy; he just needs to make calls and text, but needs a bigger keyboard. I've googled the hell out of this all morning, but can't seem to find what I'm looking for. 

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks, 
Mike",2017-01-26 11:43:40

As you know, scientist now believe that Parkinsons starts in the gut. Another research has also shown that mice that have eaten fecal matter from Parkinsons patient developed Parkinsons themselves.

Additionally, I have read many papers on the affects of fecal transplant, one study was of a mother, she had never been overweight in her life, she had fecal transplant from her daughter (I believe 14yrs old), and very quickly she became overweight and eventually obese, a while later her daughter also became overweight, showing that even hunger can be changed with fecal transplant.
(Book: Kathleen McAuliffe book is This Is Your Brain on Parasites: How Tiny Creatures Manipulate Our Behavior and Shape Society) Short youtube video on the subject https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTpooQjy2U8 )

I have yet to read a study on Parkinsons patient undergoing fecal transplant, which would be very interesting -- and might just be the cure we have been looking for.

He was very fit, going to the gym everyday, the strongest man I knew, physically and mentally. He made sure his family was taken care of. I'm 20 years old and i'm still financially dependent on my father. He made sure I never had to work so I can focus on my education and let me take my time. He never once asked for a penny, or a single help, ever. Then he was hit with a diagnosis of Parkinson's.

5 years later, My father is now 60. Retiring from work after 40 years, me being happy that he can focus on his health now. Life is detoriating at a rapid pace. My father is losing his memory, went from a few frozen instances to 95% of the time now. Cannot sleep, still sleeps <4 a night. I attend to him hours a day, with him just in bed needing help tossing and turning, help walking, help going to the bathroom, help eating. Me being in college full time, I cannot be with him all the time and my mother is forced to help him. My mother is also his age and simply does not have the physical capacity and mental energy to take care of him for much longer. 

My father is always calling me or my mom to help him, I am at a very stressful point in my life, and my whole family is at this point. We owe it all to our father but simply find it very overbearing to attend to him hours a day. It also seems that when we come to help him toss and turn in the bed, he doesn't move a single muscle or even try, it looks like he pretends to not be able to do anything when we come, which is very physically exhausting. Also if I explain that it is hard to attend all the time because I have ALOT of work to do taking college full time, I, or my mom simply cannot be there to help him move 24/7.

I sometimes think a caretaker would help, but because of my culture he doesn't seem to want one because it proves he is disabled and makes him feel low. I feel really stressed all the time as well, and sometimes get mad, because it seems when my dad isn't feeling well, he doesn't hesitate to wake everyone up in the middle of the night, and forces us to help him even though it may be as a simple as just turning him over in bed. Also when his symptoms act up, he sometimes can be very rude even though we are trying to help. I feel like a on-call doctor, and this has been going on for years. 

My father is going through alot of pain and suffering, and I wish everything can get better, but how much longer can my and my mom help him? When I start working, I won't be there all the time, my mom is getting older and simply cannot take care of another adult for much longer. My mother is a deep sleeper and always loved her sleep, but she is sleeping 4-5 hours a night for a couple years now. My family's a mess. Noone knows what we are going through so I felt I needed to rant or maybe ask for advice. Thank you.

My Grandma is 87 and was diagnosed with PD about 5 years ago. Her symptoms have gotten progressively worse, particularly when she's stressed or does too much ""work"" around the house. At her worst, she has extreme difficulty eating, usually keeps an arm behind her back, has difficulty speaking multiple sentences in a row, constantly wobbles when she sits and stands. This usually happens a couple times a day with different severity.

Last week, she fell and broke her neck. She's extremely lucky as she broke the second and third vertebrae, rather than the first, which is fatal. She's in a neck brace and was prescribed Tramadol for the pain. I went to see her yesterday, preparing for the worst, and I was shocked at how well she was doing. 

She was sitting at the kitchen table, playing cribbage, drinking water and holding a conversation with her husband and me, all while tallying points and marking them. She could switch from subject to subject and go back to what she was previously talking about with no issue. No speech delay or confusion at all. I got her lunch ready and she ate it all quickly with no issue, all while talking to me. She still had a slight shaking in her leg, but aside from that, nothing. A couple weeks ago I was over there and it took her 15 minutes to eat a cracker, but she was eating caramel filled chocolates yesterday and holding a conversation like it was nothing. Honestly, I couldn't believe it. I talked to my aunt and she said she spent the entire day there Saturday and it was the same. 

I've looked into Tramadol/Parkinsons interactions and didn't really find anything, and didn't see anything in this sub. But it's the only thing that has changed, so I have to imagine it has something to do with it. She meets with her neurologist in a couple days, but I'm just wondering if you guys might have any thoughts as to why a strong narcotic would have this type of effect on her. 

I'm not expecting this to last forever and I know it's possible it might have nothing to do with the pain pill, but it's just a very interesting (and truthfully, wonderful) thing to happen and I was curious as to your thoughts. ",2017-01-11 10:36:05

He also said “I don’t want to be a burden” at the time I thought I understood what he meant. He has always looked out for my best interest and he did not want his Parkinson’s to have a negative effect on my life. Now, two years later, it is that comment that has me really worried. He rarely talks to me about his Parkinson’s or what he is going through. When I ask about how his check ups are going he will say “nothing new” and that’s about all I will get. I tell him that I want to be there for him and I want to help him and he tells me that he appreciates that but nothing really changes. One time he showed me the extra movement he gets in his fingers after he takes his medication and I think that is the most he has ever told me about his Parkinson’s. He is still in the early stages of Parkinson’s but I am worried that as it progresses he will continue to keep it to himself and I will not be able to properly help him or be there for him. I worry that I will not know fully what he is going through or how bad the disease has progressed until it is too late and I will lose him without even knowing it. I am afraid of the future, it does feel good to just put that in words.",2017-01-03 11:53:24

I am running the 2017 Chicago Marathon in an effort to raise funds for the Van Andel Institute in support of Parkinson's and cancer research. Parkinson's disease has greatly impacted my family's life. At 40 years old my father was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. For the next ten years he struggled with the symptoms; involuntary shaking and jerking, difficulty sleeping, a blank facial expression, difficulty thinking, soft voice, and loss of fine motor skills, while doctor's tried unsuccessfully to adjust his medication and reduce his symptoms. Running out of options in 2011 he underwent a six hour operation for Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)—a set of thin wire electrodes sunk deep into his brain to carry a regulating electrical signal to his misbehaving neurons. Through DBS, medications and extensive physical therapy he has been able to delay or reduce some of these symptoms. My dad has lost so much to Parkinson's already and there is no cure. Please help me raise funds to support research to find a cure for Parkinson's disease.

 Haiyan Zhang deserves a ton of credit for that solution. I have seen the mini-gyro concept at MIT, and just didn't see how it would be feasible. I kept looking at the watch, and the comment about ""vibrating motors"".  

Thankfully I found some additional footage of the BBC shoot and two things jumped out at me. They used six motors, and timed them in a specific pattern.  

[Motor duty cycle Pattern detail](http://i.imgur.com/0q0QHsj.png) 

[Wrist Band](http://i.imgur.com/h5dts9O.png)

If you look at Actuator 1 that is a 200 ms pattern, of 5 Hz. Right in the range of normal Parkinson's tremor of 4 Hz to 7 Hz. (Essential Tremor is just a little higher). Hence the tactile vibration to interrupt the minds feedback circuit.

Details are to appear at BBC Hid GitHub link within a couple of weeks.
https://github.com/bbc/MiD

Thanks to /u/UnknownHours have a better idea on the Motors (these are 3V):
Digikey  $1.20 each  part number 1597-1244-ND   Note they spin either CW or CCW depending on polarity.  Hmm, I wonder if Haiyan's proto board had H bridges for prototyping?  Too bad current consumption for the motor isn't listed.

Small uC. Pretty simple pattern, no need for a fancy PWM, but six outputs and a simple state machine (twenty states, hard code which Output is high or low). Eight pin device would manage the motors. Maybe 14 or 18 pins gives more options (LED status, battery status, 'on/off switch')

So who can start designing watch links for a 3D Printer? I'm getting the hang of it, but my [first print](http://i.imgur.com/SDsQecf.jpg) didn't go as planned. Yes I realize I should ~~walk~~ not walk away from it when printing, but boy is that thing slow!

He's in China and has been diagnosed with Parkinson's for many years. He's currently on Madopar (levodopa), Piribedil (sustained release dopamine agonist), and Eldepryl. He's also lived with diabetes for decades and he injects insulin daily. His blood sugar control is excellent. 

When he started on Madopar he saw improvements, later added Eldepryl with no problem. A few months ago, he started having weakness in his legs. He feels that he drags his steps more, walks slower, and is generally very irritated and worried that he will not be able to walk like before. The doctors did not tell him anything useful about this, and we're not sure whether this is worsening of his Parkinson's, a side effect from his medications, or if his levodopa isn't working as effectively. He recently, under doctor's recommendation, lessened the dosage of Madopar and added Piribedil. He's since had bad nausea, poor balance, and hallucinations. He's always had some anxiety and depression issues, but because of these side effects it's gotten worse. Regular Chinese generally have poor understanding of medical knowledge, and information isn't readily available, so he attributes all of the side effects to his mental health. He saw a doctor and the doctor prescribed him trancranial magnetic stimulation, which I think is ABSURD, and at almost 80 years old it's almost certain that he will suffer terrible side effects. 

He's extremely stubborn and irritable, and doesn't listen to family members. My grandmother, at almost 80 herself as well, has another pair of disabled twin daughters to take care of in addition to dealing with my grandfather's outbursts. 

Has anyone had similar experience of side effects on levodopa+dopamine agonists, and can offer me some advice on how to manage, or what was the advice your doctor gave you, whether it be pep talks, or adjustment of medication? I'm trying to gather as much unbised information as I can, as I don't take the medical opinion of his Chinese doctors at face value. Over the years that he's seen countless doctors, I've found that they say whatever the patient wants to hear, and often prescribe expensive but harmful and inappropriate treatments.

He even fucking admitted it, after saying ""I'm fine don't worry"" for 3 years. People are starting to notice and point it out. But he refuses to do anything about it. He started physical therapy for the first 2 years, but barely does it at home anymore no matter how much we support him or tell him to do it. He won't change his diet. We can't tell if Azilect is working because he's progressing quicker than any doctor said he would. 

3 years. 3 years since being diagnosed and he's already losing balance, taking a couple steps backwards and then forwards, tripping over himself, grabbing furniture and walls to catch himself from falling. Tried asking him to walk with a cane, and his only response was that he can't do that. Never explained why. We assume it's because of the business image but who the fuck cares if he has a cane with him. At the very least it may keep him from falling. He's starting to talk in his sleep. Actually, scream. It's frightening to wake up to. He barely even uses his right hand at all, drags his right foot around. 

My 25 y.o. sister has given up because he won't listen. My 53 y.o. mom doesn't know what to do except constantly worry. I'm (22 y.o.) starting to lose hope, starting to give up. I don't know what to do anymore. Only advice I get is to support him, don't give up on him. It's all I know I can do, but it only goes so far because I can't force him to do anything. 

Upsides? There's no trembling. Just slow movement. Mom and dad are trying some homeopathic medicine this week, and I don't trust it. I tried questioning it today, asking about the ingredients and stuff. But we just ended up in another argument. I'm wrong, he's right, religion and old wives tales are better than science. But it's better than nothing I guess. Stubborn old man.

Edit: I love him. He's my idol. Seeing him go through this and barely accept our support is heartbreaking. I get that he's independent and wants to be strong for his family. But that just seems to be making things worse.",2016-11-30 13:14:26

Sarah from Invigorate PT and Wellness <info@invigoratept.com>

How'd you sleep last night? Chances are, if you're like 40% of American's, not very good.

Waking up feeling well rested is something we yearn for. Our body craves it and our brain needs it. So why's it so flipping hard to come by??

There are so many things that can throw your sleep cycle (also known as your ""circadian rhythm"") off kilter. High stress, joint pain, cramps, medications, and blue light from electronics are all culprits. Of course, the list goes on.

Since your sleep cycle is just that (a CYCLE), there are some simple ways to coax your brain and body back into rhythm. 

**In the MORNING:**

>Exercise - Getting your blood flowing in the morning triggers your body temperature to elevate and kicks your hormones and brain chemicals into action. Exercising too close to bed can excite your body and brain and make it hard to wind down.

**In the AFTERNOON:**

>Get some Sunshine - 20 minutes of direct sunshine on your skin helps cue your body and brain to nature's rhythms, making it easier for you to realize when it's time to sleep.

>Power Nap - Napping during the day can really throw your rhythm out of whack. If you absolutely need to sleep, try to restrict it to 20 minutes. Sleeping too long during the day makes it hard for your body to differentiate mornings from nights. 

**In the EVENING:**

>Power Down at 9pm - Turn your electronics off at 9pm. This includes TVs, computers, and cell phone games (yes, even Sudoku and Luminosity!). Instead, pick up a book, listen to music, drink a cup of tea, do some deep breathing or gentle stretches. Once those stimulating electronics are off your brain will start recognizing it's close to snooze-time. 

>Warm Shower - Take a short, warm shower to wind down from your day. This helps relax tense muscles and achy joints. Once you're done, your body temperature will start to fall, triggering the release of the sleep hormone melatonin. 

Try these cycle-supporting tips for the next 7 days and start to feel your rhythm return. You may notice that you fall asleep easier, wake up feeling more rested, or take fewer naps during the day. As always, head on over to The Invigorated Community [private Facebook group page](http://clicks.aweber.com/y/ct/?l=G9__Q&m=nFJI0AA2tc60Li.&b=ikpEHwFqIvuSqDM5KV_pAw) and share your sleep experience!

All my Best, ​

PS. Are you pretty tech savvy? The [Sleep Cycle app] (http://clicks.aweber.com/y/ct/?l=G9__Q&m=nFJI0AA2tc60Li.&b=Sy9MPB5tYN7l8bTkVAiOOw) uses technology in your phone to monitor your sleep rhythm. It tells you the quality of your sleep and wakes you up in the morning during the best part of your sleep cycle so you're less groggy. Best of all? It's free! 


Parkie Dude's comment: *She is one of the good guys I've meet in my odd world of travels.  I suspect we have 100's of resources like her, but just never hear of them.   Turn off your cell phone and no looking it at night. I've learned to cover my alarm clock (pointless to stare at it every 15 minutes on those bad nights, if you need to get up set an alarm, but avoid looking at the time).*",2016-11-10 20:38:08

1957,Mood swings with Parkinson's- any insight?,ParkWifeThrowaway,4,5bv5d0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parkinsons/comments/5bv5d0/mood_swings_with_parkinsons_any_insight/,8,1478660236.0,"Hey there, I'm married to a man who has early onset Parkinson's. We're in our late 30's, he started having symptoms in his mid 20's, and he's at stage 3 and progressing faster than usual. 

The last few months there have been a lot of really bad mood swings. Lots of screaming at the pets, throwing things, screaming at the computer. 

A few days ago, when I asked him to apologize for saying something nasty to me, we had one of those fights where things that can never be un-said were yelled. 

One of those was my Husband said the only reason he didn't divorce me was that no one would date someone with Parkinson's, and he didn't want to be alone when he needed full time help. That's right- my husband said the only reason he isn't leaving me is he wants me to wipe his butt. He said it in as many words. He does not like me, does not respect me, and is only not leaving me because he wants a nurse when he's helpless.

People in his family usually live till they are 80+, so we're looking at another 10 years of declining function (he's progressing faster than normal), and then yeah, butt wiping duty will commence.

I've asked him to apologize for hurting my feelings, and he won't, because he wanted my feelings to be hurt. He also said that, flat out.

This is not anything like the person I've been married to for going on 13 years now. I go to most of the neurology appointments but don't get time alone with the doctors, if that makes sense, so I can't really ask one of them if these sorts of mood swings and shift towards being vicious are normal, and if it will go away.

We have two kids, a teenage boy and girl, and they have taken to staying at school late, signing up for extra activities, and hiding at friends houses because they don't want to deal with his outbursts. When they are home, they hide in their rooms.

Are big personality shifts typical with Parkinsons? Could this be a side effect of any one of the twelve or so drugs he's on? Am I looking at having a mean, angry, vicious asshole of a husband instead of the kind, generous, fun man I married for the next 50 years? 

And I know that this was all probably cranked up by him being scared, as another symptom started showing up, but I get REALLY TIRED of him projecting and lashing out at me. 

Another one of the things I got yelled at was being unabmitious, unmotivated and lazy. I took a huge step down in my career when he got sick, and have been doing most of the house keeping, all of the parenting, and lots of care taking of him (he can't drive anymore, so I take him to all Dr.'s appointments, which meant having to take a big step down in pay and position in my company to be able to do that). He was also very career oriented and is so, so very angry about not being able to work. I think this is 90% projection, but I'm also worried about money and feeling stretched thin from all the demands on me. I don't talk to him about this because I know he just gets so hurt and upset that I'm making less money, my career isn't really going anywhere, etc but I'm only one person and I'm at the very limit of what I can do.

I just would really like to know about what portion of this I can put aside as ""That's the disease/drugs/side effects"" and how much of it is just him being a *jackass*. 

I meant it when I said in sickness or in health, but the thought of being tied to someone who does not want me, just so that I can take care of them for decades, is... more than I think I can handle. And I'll be honest, it hurts. 

Does anyone have any advice? We live in a small town and there aren't any Parkinson's support groups locally that I can get to.",2016-11-09 02:57:16

I was suddenly aware of the cold and the noise of the operating room. It was colder, and noisier than I ever remembered. I laughed to myself as I thought of the term “get comfortable” for what my purpose was. The neurosurgeon worked with me for 10 minutes positioning me half recumbent, half sitting up so that I would not move and so that I could remain still for three hours. I looked toward the anesthesiologist at the foot of the table. He had told me that they wanted me with no pre op sedation as that might suppress my tremor and he had said he would not be doing much. I asked him if he was bored. He answered, “Kind of”. I looked and listened to the noise, to the sound of cell phones ringing their distinctive rings. I had my second ‘timeout” wherein the neurologist and neurosurgeon again, asked what side, confirmed allergies, and told me again what I was there for. Redundant words, but welcome. There were fifteen people in the room, all working in their respective expertise of deep brain stimulation. There was no signal as the procedure began, the neurosurgeon explaining the local injections and prep; and the noise, the cell phones going off. During the part where he was rubbing my shaved head with an alcohol based prep solution, I looked at my right hand and my tremor was at its worst. My hand was almost sore at the wrist from three days of no medicine. It was the first time I had been off medicine for four years. The surgeon calmly walked me through even the burr hole drilling. I asked him if it he was sure it wouldn't “punch through”, suddenly plunging the drill into brain jelly. He reassured me that it was not possible to suddenly cut through. I'm not sure if he knew I was joking.

At times the room would go silent then the noise would return, the significance of each lost on me; the procedure continued. I lost time sense and suddenly the room became quiet. Then the neurosurgeon started counting down aloud from 15 and I heard a loud humming sound, like loud background noise, courtesy of one of technical folk, whose job it was to turn my brain waves into audible interpretation. It was the echoes of my deepest most fundamental electrochemistry like tiny electricians at work making noise. This part of the brain was more primitive than man’s higher thought like arithmetic or English grammar or what went into the battle of Gettysburg, but nevertheless problematic for me. The sound was the translational magic of brainwaves made into perceptible sounds then played over the loudspeakers in the operating room. As his countdown approached three, my tremor disappeared, my hand became still and the loudspeaker noise diminished. Moving only my hand up to where I had a twelve inch view of it, I closely looked at my hand slowly opening and closing it – tremor free. I choked away a tear, it was like magic.

The neurologist, neurosurgeon and the Medtronic lady chatted about position. They discussed this millimeter and that millimeter, almost a professional debate over a millimeter and a half. I thought, “Fine, you all argue all you want to, but do not move that wire! It is close enough for me”, but I did not say it. The Medtronic lady came to the other side of the OR table and said we had a good placement. She held my hand, still tremor free, and talked about low amperage. The neurologist spoke as if I was in his office and it was reassuring in that he seemed pleased. The neurosurgeon told me he was going to “lock it in”, and instructed the dormant anesthesiologist that I could rest now. I watched him push in the contents of a 3 cc syringe into the IV line, and then I awoke in neurosurgery ICU.

My tremor was gone and for the rest of the day I constantly replayed the most dramatic 30 minutes of that operating room countdown in my mind over and over. There in ICU, unlike previous surgery with pre-op medication, I re-examined my hand visually, looking for tremor. Without pre op medication like Versed and other amnesia producers, the events of the morning were clear and vivid. I was grateful, feeling like someone on the forefront of medical science. I was a benefactor of deep brain stimulation and the journey I was on had taken a new turn for the better.

A general anesthetic a week later for the battery generator and wiring from brain to abdominal wall left me foggy and feeling strange. My sequencing ability, like arithmetic solutions or the password to my computer, seemed lost. I gradually cleared up, and my future began to reemerge. Follow-up appointments with the neurologist explained that I had brain swelling and as that brain swelling improved, the tremor would return. The trauma of surgery into that private space had in fact, silenced my tremor briefly, but the programming of my new abdominal box was needed to send the electrical signal into the trouble spot. At the first programming of the generator, I was expecting too much, I was not listening to the programmer; rather I had my own mind made up that I would make instant progress. I became increasingly despondent over a period of a few days. Finally, and I called her and she explained that they were just starting and that it often it took months to find just the right settings. Several more times to the doctor’s office, and many reassurances later, the tremor did as predicted and went away with the gentle use of clever stimulation electrically.

The Parkinson’s disease is still there. It is hiding, not therapeutically “cured” or even “in remission”, just out of sight, out of mind for once, or as they say – “controlled.” For now it has been conquered by greater force, controlled by a very small amount of electricity. The disruption in that primal brain part causes so much misery, so many symptoms and its own depression. It felt so good to be free of the tremor that had become an ever waking, minute by minute occupation with medicines, and timing and what to combine with what for the best effect. That battle has just been put off not avoided, but it seems like such a blessing for now.

It is June with the procedure performed in March. No tremor. Again, I still have Parkinson’s disease, but the depression is better, I can write again, and I can think of other topics late at night; or entertain other causes of my deepest fears. The world is good and I have a lot of work to do before this comes back. A lot of work before those tiny electricians figure out that they are being hoodwinked by stimulation to my sub thalamic nucleus. I have a lot of work to do, indeed.

So I'm a drummer and about a year ago I noticed my right (dominant) foot was not operating the bass drum pedal as well as it usually was and I had trouble hitting continuous notes past any reasonable speed. I was worried it was focal dystonia. I saw a neurologist about it in June and he ran a bunch of blood tests on me and I got an MRI, all of which he said came back perfectly fine, as did the reflex tests he did and whatnot, so he didn't even officially diagnose me with dystonia.

Fast forward a few months and my right foot is pretty awful drumming now; way worse than it was even 6 months ago. (I'm learning to play with my left, which feels way looser and more natural at this point, so whatever). More concerning to me is the semi constant state of tightness and relatively frequent twitching) in that leg and foot. It's even worse when I'm worrying about it, which is most of the time because I just can't help myself.

 In addition, my writing hand has been acting up as well and sometimes I have trouble grasping my pencil. I feel a tickle (not a tingle) in the wrist area and I gotta relax and let it pass by. No trouble closing the fist or moving any of the digits, just grasping the pencil. (I've never really had trouble holding a drumstick for the record). I noticed that keeping my 4 fingers on that hand at rest on a surface and raising my index finger, the finger tends to twitch about a bit. So of course, like an idiot, I stumble around various parts of the medical internet until I read that early onset PD starts on one side of the body and freak out. As for other symptoms, no real urgent balance problems or walking/exercise problems. Not sure about family history, will have to check that out soon. I have a follow up with my neurologist in a month. 

I've definitely struggled with anxiety about illness before. I've had problems in the past where I felt nauseous all the time and worried about it constantly. I'm hoping this is more of the same but again, I just can't help myself. Thoughts?",2016-10-22 14:35:35

Once upon a time, my dad had his own landscaping business and was very good with tools. For obvious reasons, he had to retire. It has been almost three years since he was diagnosed with PD and he hasn't worked in a long time. He has expressed that he feels bored and wants to work. I told him he should take up a hobby but he wants to work and have a bit of pocket money.    
As he's well past his prime (76), I know it will be unlikely he'll be able to find a place to work and even less with PD. I'll keep having a hobby on the table for him. However, if there is even a possibility of being able to work, I'd like to explore that avenue. My dad is willing to do anything. Even selling papers and magazines in a stand or bussing tables would keep depression at bay. I want to help improve his sense of self and quality of life in whatever way I can.    
If you have PD and are still working, I'd like to hear from you. If you aren't working, what do you do to keep yourself from going stir crazy? Advice, hobby suggestions, personal experiences, anything is welcomed.

My mother and I are now frantically reading every bit of literature we can... But that still doesn't prepare you for the conversations and feelings that transpire (or don't transpire) from the fall out of diagnosis.

He's been started on sleeping tablets whilst we were waiting for the MRI results. So now he has to go back to his consultant and start on whatever PD meds he suggests (Sinemet I guess?)

She's really bad at asking me to put more books on it, however, as she doesn't want to ask her grandchild to buy her things. So we talked, I got a laptop for my her husband to learn and help her with but she's still interested in learning to do it herself, understandably. He's kind of a nervous nelly that he's going to break something by pressing the wrong button despite previously being a fearless mechanic. I did some searching and found these keyguards you can stick on a laptop keyboard to surround the keys which theoretically will keep her from knocking other keys as she types, but it looks like it would be hard to aim one's finger at the keys at all. 

* So my first question is, are [keyguards and rollermice](http://ndipat.org/blog/computer-access-and-parkinsons-3-great-products-and-a-freebie/) actually helpful?

* My second question is the smartphone- what's best? I'm thinking Siri or a high end Android that takes voice commands?

She and pop really want a smartphone instead of their old flip, they're just so interested in all the things they see everyone else doing on them. Also the thought was that a smartphone might be better for my grandmom because she could use voice commands instead of struggling to hit the tiny buttons on the current cell or home phones. I tried searching but again only found one proposed option, the [Iris Phone](http://www.iris-phone.com/) which is still in testing (not to mention it seems it'll only help make phone calls, she still needs a phone to track voice commands if she wants to Google something, for example??). 

* Last question is open ended-- please tell me if you've got a better suggestion I haven't even thought of!

I noticed in the 2 weeks I spent @ 2mg that my tremors seemed a little less frequent, but were actually more pronounced in amplitude.  Am currently on day 3 of 4mg regimen and have noted cramping in my legs, really constipated (eating lots of fiber and 100oz water/day), and still the tremors seem more severe but less frequent.  I also seem to tire more easily and have bouts of sleepiness during day. I googled the drug side effects and these seem pretty frequently reported...
My questions are:
Does the cramping,constipation, sleepiness dissipate as you get used to the drug?
Do your tremors improve when using the drug long-term?
Have you noticed more fatigue when working out while on this drug?

Article does a decent job of what is going on in the background.  Initial Reports indicated of 12 test subjects, all had improved. While it looks promising, that is a very small sample of people.   

Researchers have learned if we give someone medication and tell them to take it daily, exercise, diet, and try to get a good nights sleep they all improve.  

So when MJFF reviewed the initial results, they realized there are issues. I think it is fantastic Foundation and really tries to steer money into the right research for maximum impact.  I also understand the Scientist at Georgetown University feels he should be in charge of his own research, and shouldn't have to answer to anyone else.   I've worked with both types of personalities in the past and it is interesting, but thanks to a large diverse family have learned often both sides have valid point.

Just thought this was interesting.  I'm dealing with PD and Cancer (Lung NSC-adenocarinoma) so would love to be in a volunteer trail, but don't qualify. Thankfully via [MJFF Trial Search](https://foxtrialfinder.michaeljfox.org/) I am involved with others.

I just returned from San Diego where I had the most inspiring and hopeful weekend of my life. I visited the Scripps research lab working on a ground breaking new stem cell therapy for Parkinson's. 
 
I know many of you will read that and be immediately flooded with skeptical thoughts. All I can do at this point is ask that you bear with me, read what I have to say, do the research for yourself and then decide how much you want to believe this. I am a natural born skeptic and have read and researched hundreds of treatment options that in the end gave nothing but false hope. I have reason to believe that this is different. Before going into more detail I'll start by saying that they are working with the FDA and have successfully completed pre pre IND.
 
In my head the problem has always seemed rather simple; neurons in my brain that produce a neurotransmitter called dopamine are dead (dopamine is primarily responsible for coordinating movement and regulating mood among other things). If those neurons are not coming back I need to either replace them or find a way to perform whatever job they were doing. Parkinson's research to date has mostly been the latter, through a variety of drugs and procedures doctors try to mimic the effect of those dopamine producing neurons. However, the DNA that encodes the instruction manual from which those cells derive their structure and function evolved over millions and survived the fiercest struggle for survival the history of the earth has ever known. We can try and figure out everything those cells do and reproduce their effects, but we will in essence be racing to catch up with everything our DNA learned over millions of years of evolution. Or we can try a different approach, rather than trying to reproduce the effect those dead neurons had, we can try to re-grow those neurons and insert them in place of the dead ones. This is exactly what researchers such as the team in San Diego (along with Harvard medical school and other labs around the world) are now doing, using pluripotent stem cells, (pluripotent just means those stem cells are capable of becoming a number of different cells) scientists are trying to re-grow those dead neurons and transplant them back into the patient's brain. Recently they have seen stunning results in animal models and they are hoping to push forward with the first human trials in 2018.
 
At my own expense I traveled from Canada to San Diego where I went on a lab tour and met with the team of scientists, doctors, nurses and patients. I was blown away by not only the work they are doing but by the community they have built and by the hospitality of all those involved and the empathy and care of the people working there. Everyone has rallied behind this cause and as a result they have something that no other Parkinson's community I have come across has, real hope. They truly believe that this will bring about the end of this disease. Perhaps you too will be able to look back at this message and remember it as the time when you first heard about this project that allowed you to look back and remember the time when you had Parkinson's rather than still living with it.

I didn't think of PD until my doctor suggested it, because I don't have tremor. I started taking l-dopa 2 weeks ago. It's reduced rigidity and improved my balance, but I still walk slowly.

I don't have a car. I walk a lot, and take the bus. Last Thursday, I was hurrying to catch a bus when I tripped on a crack in the sidewalk. This happens every so often, because a lot of tree-roots undermine the sidewalks.

As I was going down, I put my hands up to break the fall. I was worried about breaking a wrist, which I've done before, but I never doubted that my hands would get to the ground first until I was face-down on the concrete with blood spurting out of my nose. This was the first time this had ever happened to me. 

Someone called paramedics, but I decided I didn't need to go to the hospital. The EMT said it didn't look like my nose was broken, though it's a little off-center now that the swelling has gone down. I was just so relieved that neither my glasses nor my bridgework was broken. The most obvious sign has been my lurid purple raccoon eyes.

From what little I've been able to find online, once my hands-reflex gets too slow to break my fall, every fall like that is going to land on my face. This is the first time I've ever been afraid to go walking. I've been going to work, and grocery shopping, but I've been worried about tripping, and I've skipped a couple of social activities where I'd have to walk to and from a bus stop after dark. 

I don't have anyone to look after me, so I have to keep walking for transportation. It's also the closest I get to aerobic exercise. What are some ways I can minimize potential damage, especially to my front bridgework, which would be very expensive to replace? I've wondered about a boxer's mouth guard, or a catcher's mask.

The total amount has been 200mg of levodopa and 100mg of carbidopa, which should be considered very low since 300mg/100mg is often the starting dose in PD. However, I wanted to try to get off which i started. My doc. was in on it. One pill for 14-30 days and then evaluate. I cut the half of the pill for 14 days and chrashed a bit the first week. However was fine later with some cravings. Now i cut the other halv which means that i have been off 1 pill of sinemet and two weeks in, I have the worst withdrawal ever. And I have been on benzo WD which I was on for years that was easier to get off.

Can any relate except the anecdotal evidence in the article below? I read somewhere that it can take 1-3 weeks for it to be stable but this feels like I am going off a drug. Anxiety threw the roof, fells like jumping out of the window (not gonna, don't worry). I feel extremely weak and numbness in body.

Some would say ""wait it out"" due to the length i have been on it but anyone that can say something about it because this is the only valid research i can found that supports it. Cravings is not an evidence because it can relates to the expected relief of symptoms in PD an RLS (dont have either).

I'm here on behalf of my dad. He's 60-years old, and having a rough time at the moment with his desease. His hamstring is really stiff, it contracts and makes it hard to find a comfortable position to sit in. But in general his body is quite stiff, which makes it all harder.

I was wondering if anyone has any experience with dealing with issues like this? I know it's different for everyone, but I guess it's important to keep trying new things until you find something that helps you, at least for a while. So that's why we're interested in what worked for other people.

So, any tips, trics, experiences, links, or anything else that could help us, would make me - and my dad - really happy! If you need more information in order to give a good answer, no problem, just tell me!

He is in his late 60's, lives in a 55 and up community and divorced.  He has never been in good health, he suffered a back injury 20+ years ago and has been on disability ever since.  He has A Lot of issues, baggage, whatever you would like to call it besides the PD.  My husband and I recently moved closer to him and the rest of our family to help out, unfortunately we have discovered that he is in complete denial about his condition, both physical and mental components.  
About 2 months ago he had a fall in his apartment due to alcohol intoxication (likely combined with prescription pain meds he takes) and ended up in the hospital then a skilled nursing facility at our request.  He is unfit to live alone anymore as he cannot control his drinking/ medication use and is prone to falling as his balance continues to deteriorate.  We have attempted to speak with him about entering an Assisted Living facility to which he is not receptive.  He would really like ""someone"" to come and take care of him (meaning one of us, or coming to live with us), which cannot happen.  My husband and I both have to work, our other family members work full time and are already burnt out from dealing with him.  He is clearly depressed, is prescribed meds for depression (fluoxetine), only we don't know how compliant he is with his meds which is yet another concern.  
He literally has no desire to participate in his therapy (home therapists come a few times a week, but they have told him that they can tell he is not putting in the work necessary as his strength is not improving nor is his balance or endurance).  I am a therapist myself and have attempted to work on safety with him, proper use of his walker, etc and he just ignores everything (which is why I stopped attempting to help).  He does not utilize his walker, or any safety strategies, or any self organizational strategies he has been educated on by his therapists.  
This is all very frustrating, but even more so because he is actually SO self absorbed, Everything is about him-just the wrong things.  He is so wrapped up in his appearance and whether or not he will find a girlfriend, rather than improving his ability to stand up independently, being able to walk or just simple things.
My poor husband is so frustrated and I dont know what we should do.  Do we just allow him to live alone until he has a fall and breaks something and then ends up in long-term care?  I know that we cannot force him to become motivated, I just don't understand.",2016-08-02 03:17:49

I'm in my late twenties and honestly didn't know much about the disease, especially non motor symptoms, until I saw the referring neurologist last fall. Had put off the appointment due to finishing grad school, but neuro didn't mention PD and I just never gave it much thought. I figured some people just get tremors. 

After my appointment with MDS though, I took the dumb plunge of researching a disease I don't have a confirmed diagnosis  for, which historically never did me any good for the other medical issues I have. However in this case I realized how many symptoms, both motor and non motor, I have been experiencing for years and had just chalked up to the mystery disease that my rheumatologist couldn't identify. Connective tissue disorder NOS. 

This has made me wonder something more general about this disease. I've read many times that non motor symptoms predate the motor ones by years in many cases, things like pain (I have been in pain management for years but not all of my pain fit the damage visible on my MRIs), seborrheic dermatitis (have had this for years, but started getting much much worse and harder to manage around the time motor symptoms emerged), loss of sense of smell (have had slight decrease but not total loss), and voice changes (has happened gradually with me but in my case after first motor symptoms though I've read some people have this pre motor). What I'm wondering is if the dopamine cell death or whatever it is called starts around when these premotor symptoms start, since they say significant loss has already occurred by the time motor signs emerge, or do people start losing dopamine long before the first non motor signs? Would a DATScan show dopamine carrier loss years and years before any symptoms begin or is it later? Basically, do they know yet roughly when the very beginning of the disease process takes place? Was it something I was born with and this was just a ticking time bomb or does the underlying disease itself start at adulthood, just before these things start happening? 

Was there anything I could have done to prevent this? I feel so guilty. I was reckless when I was in college in terms of drug experimentation and drinking at parties. I feel like I may have ruined my life, and I also worry about my friends I partied with who did more than me if they are going to get this too. Right now my doc is leaning toward PD but wants to rule out multiple systems atrophy (another new term I learned recently... At least this situation has been educational) so he is going to do a ""Sinemet Challenge"" (??) in July. MSA seems even worse, so it feels very strange to be hoping it is PD instead, but I obviously can't tell anyone I'm hoping this since it would come off wrong. 

I know this has turned into a bit off my own topic, I'm sorry. This whole thing is just becoming overwhelming and I don't want to vent on friends and family and worry them before I get a diagnosis. Even then I'm not sure who I'll tell and what I'll tell them. I'm full of fear and guilt and I keep thinking about how I could have done things differently and maybe this never would have come up. I told two of my best friends that I am having movement problems and half jokingly said something along the lines of ""watch me get Parkinson's knowing my luck"" which is fucked in so many ways. I wasn't appreciative of how lucky I have actually been in life and I feel like I may have even jynxed myself. 

If I had some non motor symptoms for many  years, is it possible that it is something else and unrelated. Or is it more likely that having a combination of obscure symptoms for a few years and developing some cardinal signs means I need to start coming to terms with a likely diagnosis? I feel bad hoping the Sinemet works, as I've had other issues that couldn't get a diagnosis and thus couldn't even get managed. I'm basically just lost. Last summer my biggest concerns were finishing school and trying to fix things with my ex. Now I feel good for her dodging the bullet of having to deal with this. I finished school but the job I accepted last fall starts in two months and is very physically demanding and my motor symptoms are becoming more pronounced. I just feel like my world is going the wrong direction. 

I would love to hear any stories from members about how they handled their diagnosis in terms of telling people and managing the emotional side of a diagnosis like this. Bonus points if it involved telling parents. Did anyone get therapy? I have this ominous feeling about telling them, similar to being a teenager and telling them I did something wrong, but maybe that is just because I feel responsible for this. 

I'm really sorry for how all over the place this  got. Holding my feelings in about this hasn't done me a lot of favors and I probably sound crazy and/or  pathetic. I would really appreciate any advice or guidance or personal experiences to give me some perspective of things. 

Thanks so much ",2016-06-13 16:04:59
2103,Isolation & Self-Isolation Vs. Compensation Therapy,abibegin,5,4muhym,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parkinsons/comments/4muhym/isolation_selfisolation_vs_compensation_therapy/,3,1465267043.0,"This portion was written March 27, 2016.

It has been 19 months and 2 days since my 20 foot fall onAugust 24, 2014. October 3,2014, I learned that I can no longer smell. My first reaction was shock. I learned when I whiffed my husband’schest to smell his cologne while we were watching a movie. I learned that it was not there. When we returned home, I picked up every bottle that had a scent: dishwashing detergent, bleach,shampoo,etc. Nothing..It was all gone. A short time later, I told my neurosurgeon about this find, and he replied that if it did not return six months from my accident that it was permanent. There was no warning of danger. There was no emphasis to keep eating and to find a way to enjoy it. Maybe he did not say anything because there is nothing he can do to fix a dead olfactory nerve.

As time passed, I learned I cannot “taste” flavor anymore. I learn that all I have is what my taste buds allow me to have and that flavors are stimulated from smell. This caused me to not want to eat. I would rather other people enjoy food than me “steal” it from them. After all, the enjoyment was and still is gone. Every time smell is mentioned, it has caused me to feel isolated. My response was to cut myself off even more, thinking that would reduce the pain. However, it only causes more pain to be isolated from the world and then to cut myself off from it even more.

My husband, Dan, loves fragrant flowers. He bought some for our new yard last spring. Every time the wind would blow and he could smell their fragrances, he would mention it. It is sad, I will not lie. Then, my granddaughter made remarks, so instead of letting it bring me down, I took her around our yard to smell every blooming bush we had. I did this for her, and I did it for me to help me to raise my head higher and at least for the moment not feel such loss.

This year we had mandevillas die over the winter. I decided to buy jasmine for my husband to give him what he loves: fragrant flowers. Was it difficult to open the store’s door? Yes. It was even more difficult to talk to the representative about my loss and my goal.. and how I cannot begin to sense what might be the most fragrant. I brought the dormant vine back, and we have planted it.

My whole reasoning behind buying this vine is to help me face what I will never gain. Furthermore, it is to give permission to my loved ones to enjoy what they have not lost. I do not have the end of this story yet; however, this seems much healthier than giving in to the natural isolation followed by me causing more isolation. I am the cause of this jasmine being in our yard, and I am the one giving pleasure to my husband. No, I cannot enjoy it as he can. Yet, giving to him beyond what I can personally experience does offer fulfillment. After all, I love him and my children so much that I do not want to keep them from pleasure.

I believe this is a concept that can be used by many, not just anosmics. We all have disabilities or deficiencies. We should not deprive others from what they still have. Furthermore, when we give to them in the ways we cannot appreciate firsthanded shows and gives loves beyond comfort; however, it helps us accept our faults ALONG WITH opens to door to forgiving ourselves of the shortcomings we have in our lives.

This part was written June 4. 2016.

I have given more thought into compensation therapy. I bought a jasmine plant for my husband for his pleasure and the hopes that I could slowly accept my olfactory nerve being dead for life. The thing is there are so many other people who have suffered loss or never functioned with all the senses and body parts as the average healthy human was born having. Writing about smell loss is not enough. Furthermore, this concept has not had enough articulation. Below is a list of losses and ways for each of them to be accepted and even vicarious appreciation that others have what we do not. I will be adding emotional issues onto this. As aforementioned, the array is vast and will take time for me to explore and articulate any conditions and challenges that come to mind to help us all to accept and forgive ourselves for things we cannot help. Furthermore, I will be posting ideas to help social issues, as they are correlated to many brain conditions, not to mention this may be how any one reading might already function without any biological / physiological reason known.

Smell loss: Aromatic candles and potpourri, fragrant flowers, baking

Memory loss: photography, videography, planning events for you and others for memories that will be at least be remembered by some, listening to others sharing their memories, writing / blogging, story telling or even writing short stories

Visual loss: Art, Lacy tablecloths, Curtains with more than one fabric in the print, Picking the driver to spend time with that person, keep going out instead of becoming a hermit.. learn how to observe people and nature without sight… listening to birds communicate to each other… listening to who shuffles his feet, etc.

Hearing loss: Music with tempos that others enjoy to percussion that deaf person can appreciate. Working with your friends and loved ones to help create your own sign language to and for those whom are close to you.

Taste loss: Textured foods, serving beautiful plates of food with garnishes, etc.

Amputee: Picking help based on their abilities and their company. Give gifts to others for what they can do and you cannot that is pleasurable to the other. For instance, crochet needles, patterns, and yarn or running shoes.

None of my senses grew with the loss of smell. I have a difficult time believing this happens. Now, the closest I can imagine is other senses becoming more emphasized but not actually greater.. with better skills. It is more of an emphasis because it’s what I have not lost WITHOUT it being greater.

Another means of acceptance / compensation is making light of the loss. Here’s the kicker… how to do with this without feeling worse. How to do this without a passive-aggressive, angry stance. I can be quite internally violent with humor, causing more anger. I do not always do this, but there are times… especially given the company I am keeping at that moment. Humor is an interesting topic. There is a way that humor bonds us, and there is a way that it separates us, i.e. blonde jokes… jokes about clergymen, women jokes, etc. The flipside is (or can be) making fun of my foul cooking or saying I will change a diaper when I can smell it. I feel a lot of humor depends on the mood the survivor/patient has at that very moment ALONG with the company I am keeping at that moment and what connotation the company’s humor veers.",2016-06-07 03:37:23

My dad was recently diagnosed with Parkinson's and is being pretty hard-headed about it. He's in his mid-60's and used to be very active and happy. With this diagnosis, he's in denial and refusing to take necessary steps to improve his health and address his symptoms. He has left side tremors in his hand and arm. He overworks himself and keeps the schedule of a much younger man, mainly out of stubbornness. In the past few years, he's lost a lot of his athletic kick and confidence. But, I know he's still a badass in there somewhere. He's a guillain barre survivor who raised two kids, has traveled the world and is smarter than anybody else I know. I guess that's why it's so surprising that he's fighting me on taking better care of himself. I'm not exactly sure how to help him, whether it's tough love he needs or gentle understanding, but I do know that knowledge is power. Anybody experiencing something similar who can share their lessons learned? Any insight would be much appreciated.

4 years ago, I started having hand tremors. Beginning 4 weeks ago, I started having problems walking and standing (even falling many times within the day and being unable to walk or stand AT ALL from as short as a few seconds to more than an hour), and using my feet, arms, and hands. They get all stiff, and often they jerk without the presence of seizures. It's become hard to do simple tasks especially those that require a lot of finger dexterity. I'm an artist but have been unable to draw without being too exhausted because I can't keep my hands still enough to use them properly.

You might say I've just started exhibiting Parkinsons-ish symptoms.

I'm not taking Sinemet or any PD meds. No diagnosis of PD either or any movement disorder. My epilepsy came first. I also have psych issues ranging from schizoaffective to OCD so my doctors keep assuming it's just the psych talking or I'm just stressed. It's been confirmed it isn't just epilepsy. But I have been stable for a while now, my therapy is working great, meds working great, and the thing is, those PD-like episodes kick in usually when my psych side is totally stable. No anxiety, no nothing. Often I'm having a good time with others or I'm working, and it happens.

But lately it's been causing my depression because I'm so frustrated my doctors aren't taking me seriously, keep saying it's psych psych psych, just don't think about it and it'll go away -

We've been testing this out for psychogenic roots for weeks and it's been negative consistently. But I'm so frustrated my doctors aren't doing anything about it. I'm still having trouble doing simple tasks and their advice is just get a different job, join theater, take up a team sport, etc.

That's for my psych issues, not my legs etc. That can't fix my legs.

So what do you guys think? I'm desperate. Is it possible to have PD-like symptoms with a preexisting epilepsy and schizoaffective?

Should I see a movement disorder specialist or will they still assume it's psych?

UPDATE: I just saw a movement disorder specialist. The working diagnosis is PKD (paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia) which is connected to epilepsy and schizoaffective in terms of the damage areas. We're still going to test out that theory with Dilantin. The doctor is working with my epileptologist. She said it's more ""too much movement"" than ""too little movement,"" so hyperkinesia > hypokinesia. I do have a relative with Parkinsons though. I am sort of hoping it's ""just"" PKD; PKD is so close to Huntington's apparently since both involve hyperkinesia and I really do not want that. HD is scary af.",2016-05-04 14:20:00

New to this subreddit and figured I'd say hello to this little community. I wanted to test the waters a bit and gauge how many younger folks are on here dealing with their affected parents. 

I've found it to be particularly tough being a caregiver for my father at a young age, with almost no sort of support group besides the rest of my immediate family (god bless my mom and sister). My dad was diagnosed at 55 when I was still in high school. Now eight years later at 24, he at 63, I've found our relationship to be strained. I moved back home after college to share some of the responsibilities with my amazing mother. He refuses to accept our help, whether it be suggestions on things he struggles with (and boy, do we hear him complain about it) or if we try and implement potentially helpful gadgets. He shuts them down. I understand the dynamic can be daunting as he probably sees our suggestions as ganging up on him. 

Back to my question though. I guess what  I'm asking is do y'all know of any resources for the younger caregivers? For either my mom or myself? I've only been to one support group attended by a handful of middle aged and older people that were there for their parents. My mom regularly attends support groups that she claims to be the youngest person there among flocks of much older couples (whose spouses are also affected).

Any help is appreciated!

I hear the analogy about a slow moving truck which will eventually run me down, and I chuckle - because it seems so ludicrous that I can't avoid this somehow.

That caused a lot of stress in her life and messed up her thyroid glands. The doctor said she had Hyperparathyroidism and that was the cause of her shanking, slow movement and fatigue. She had surgery a couple years later ago but she isn't any better.

My mom now went to a natural health center, and the practitioner looked at my moms eyes and said she had adrenal fatigue. My parents spent 300 on natural supplements to help my mom. I researched adrenal fatigue and it just seems like my mom has something worse. I mean i hope she has adrenal fatigue and these supplements wont work but i just don't buy it.

I wish my mother would go to a neurologist but i think she is in denial and or scared to admit she might have parkinsons. My grandmother had it as well. Inside its killing me because i would love to see her get better. If she had parkinsons i would love for her to get the proper help to help her symptoms because i know its not curable. 

Her symptoms:

* Fatigue
* shakiness
* slow movement
* depression
* off balance

Symptoms she doesn't show:

* Small handwriting
* Loss of smell
* Constipation
* Masked Face

I'm wondering if there's some kind of toy or game I could get him that doesn't require fine motor skills or much movement. He used to build computers  so some kind of gadget  he could tinker with or a game might be good too. 

I always struggle with gifts and would like to get him something to stimulate his mind instead of just physical comforts like new socks. 

Also I should mention that he's falling into dementia and gets confused about what's going on a lot so it can't be very complicated. Im really having a hard time thinking of something. My best idea was some magnetic balls he could manipulate and shape around but I ended up just ordering regular ball bearings and I can't find anything like I was imagining.

Very-low-carbohydrate diets or ketogenic diets have been in use since the 1920s as a therapy for epilepsy and can, in some cases, completely remove the need for medication. From the 1960s onwards they have become widely known as one of the most common methods for obesity treatment. Recent work over the last decade or so has provided evidence of the therapeutic potential of ketogenic diets in many pathological conditions, such as diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome, acne, neurological diseases, cancer and the amelioration of respiratory and cardiovascular disease risk factors. The possibility that modifying food intake can be useful for reducing or eliminating pharmaceutical methods of treatment, which are often lifelong with significant side effects, calls for serious investigation. This review revisits the meaning of physiological ketosis in the light of this evidence and considers possible mechanisms for the therapeutic actions of the ketogenic diet on different diseases. The present review also questions whether there are still some preconceived ideas about ketogenic diets, which may be presenting unnecessary barriers to their use as therapeutic tools in the physician's hand.

An old friend of mine has just come out with a GoFundMe page for her family. I wasn't aware that the situation they are in is so dire, but with 6 kids at college age and a very sick father, it's no wonder they need some help. I know she is not familiar with Reddit, which is another reason why I am here to help.  

One of the conditions the father has is arthritis. I don't know if any of you have any resources to provide about how this family can go about getting funding for their father (outside of the GoFundMe page). 

If you would like to provide helpful suggestions that is greatly appreciated. The GoFundMe link is provided here in case you would like to read their story and donate as well. Anything is appreciated!

My question:  he has trouble filling the hours of his days.  He says he needs something to challenge and engage his mind, something that he can work on over time.  He feels useless and unneeded.

He attempted suicide one year ago because of these feelings.  He received great treatment after that, but I sense a retreat of momentum.  Is there anything he can do on a regular basis that could help him feel useful, engage his mind on an appropriate level?  Some web-based class or something?

My grandmother has a disease very similar to Parkinson's; she is confined to a wheelchair, has strong tremors so cannot feed herself well and her hand motor functions are greatly impaired.

She can't see very well anymore, but her mind is sharp as a tack. Her only entertainment these days is audiobooks. I have downloaded tons of them for her and have an iPod to put them on, but I need a way for her to play them!

She is in a nursing home so they prefer that she uses headphones to listen.

I need your help to find an easy way that she can listen to her books. I was thinking of some kind of ipod dock with wireless headphones? I think the buttons would have to be big, though.

She was using a Discman before with success, but we would need an enormous amount of CDs to put the books on, and she may have trouble loading them in the device.

Do you have any suggestions or solutions? I really want to bring some quality back into her life. I live far away and don't get to see her often and would like to do this for her.

This article is also posted on my blog. I have read that Parkinson's patients can have anosmia, thus me reaching out to this subreddit. I have more posts about anosmia on my blog itself, which has categories.

This is a very difficult topic to write, as this offially the first autumn that I have experienced with more of the understanding of having anosmia. I have a friend who was born with it, so he never has smelled anything ever. Once my husband, Dan, asked me which is worse, to be born with it or to lose your ability to smell. I told him BEFORE knowing my friend, Jim, that I felt that they were equal cases with different aspects.  I still agree with that stance. Here, Jim has never had the experience of smelling food his mother has prepared, the smell of a woman naturally or with cologne and many other natural scents. Whereas, I had a sense of smell, and now it is gone. So, congenital anosmia cases never smell from the day they are born, and then most anosmics had it and it’s gone. Some of us never know anything about flavors (as the only thing anosmics taste is bitter, sweet, salty, and sour versus smoky, pungent, etc.) and most of us must learn to cope with learning how to face our losses and find other ways of enjoying life.

There are many different aspects of autumn: the smell of a cinammony pumpkin pie, smoky food grilling in the barbecue pit, roasted turkey, hot chocolate and hot apple cider with cinnamon and cloves. Autumn is full of pleasant weather, and has many family and friend activies: barbecues, Thanksgiving dinner, football at the park and lots of steamy drinks to warm our chilled bodies.

For anosmics, hearing about smells and tastes is stifling. It is like sitting in a room filled with people who are speaking a language even you never knew or even forgot. How do you speak about something you cannot determine? Do I speak from what I remember? Does Jim speak about what he does not even understand? Or do we simply say we cannot relate, which isolates us even more from the conversation? It is a tough call. How can you speak from your being about a gardenia you never smelled or can no longer smell? How can you speak of only 4 tastes and no flavors? It is debillitating and very depressing.

There are some things we have, or at least most of us have: sound, touch, and sight. Focusing on these and even talking about them can help us deter from conversations that make us sad, while offering attention to ourselves and others about what we have in common. Not all jokes are about smells and odors. Pranks, blunders, and even embarrassing moments are worth laughs. This is what we have. This is a way for us to enjoy each season. We hear the rustling of colorful leaves falling from the trees, see the pets trying to steal our barbecued foods and enjoy all the topsy-turvy events in football and many other sports events. Also, birds are calling to the other sex for mating… even female birds do this in autumn. I am sure they are delighted they have their empty nests. This is what we have. This is what we have not lost, and while we have these abilities, we should be thankful for that and focus on what we have in common instead of what separates us from other people. Maybe eating is a chore. For me it is. Maybe we can’t articulate how wonderful the cook worked, but we can share memories, insight and listen to what others have to say and enjoy being a part of a moment that can be a memory if you SELECTIVELY CHOOSE TO MAKE IT ONE. The problem with anosmia and what little we think of as bonding us to others versus US PROACTIVELY BONDING with EVERYONE in the ways that we can WITH THE ABILITIES WE STILL HAVE.

Think of it this way: my husband is dyslexic. He is not one good in spelling. However, he is good with renovating houses, teaching dance through the concepts of physics. He has taught me that I teach people how to treat me. Does he have a disability? Yes, he does. We all do.. dyslexia, blindness, stuttering, limping, etc. None us are perfect, and we must grow to accept our imperfections in ways we form, every season, all season long.",2015-09-26 15:07:38

The problem: Treatments are conducted in a lab with the patient strapped to a chair, sometimes for more than 20 hours, and assisted by a medical technician.  

Our Solution: Create wearable garments that will cover the hardware and allow the patient to be mobile while undergoing treatment.

Products: Hats, Scarfs and hoodies that are connected to a bag that holds the computer device (laptop) and hides the wires.

Our question to you: Would you, or someone you know, recommend our accessories to a patient or family member who undergoes treatment?

Here's a what the treatment process looks like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gweo_ipsYLg

I'll get right to it...

I'm a 28 year old male that has been having tremors in several places.  I first noticed that my left hand pinky finger had tremors at random in about 2004, when I was 17.  I did nothing about it and just wrote it off.  The pinky tremor is still happening, though the primary finger with tremors is currently my right index finger.  It is not too bad in what I have do stop doing, things like using an iPhone or typing on a computer, to using a mouse.  It typically only lasts for a few minutes at a time and also happens at random.  I'm getting more nervous after reading aroung Reddit and other websites like MJF Foundation and MayoClinic.  (I know, I know, those are not as good as a doctor, I should go see a doctor.  I agree, but I want to weigh options and get the best opinion from my friends at Reddit first.)  I should add, when my right index finger doesn't twitch, it seems like the muscle is tight or tense, even leading into the top of my hand.

At random, I feel like my body twitches as if it's trying to get comfortable.  My elbows are sore a lot.  Also, I had surgery on my right knee and the doctor shaved off excess tissue that was found.  I have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and bi-polar disorder (II) in the recent past.  I have also been diagnosed recently with fibromyalgia.  I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia due to chronic pain from my neck to my knees and everywhere in between.

As I have learned more and more, I am seeing things that I do (or don't do) that seem to also correspond with PD, such as noticing that when I walk, my right arm seems to hardly move.  After thinking about a lot of conversations, I am told by my wife and best friend that I have just told them something for the x'th time and how do I not remember.  It's embarrassing.  My words have seemed to get lost in translation, if I can even find a substitute word for what I was trying to say in the fist place.  Typing used to be a great thing for me, and I could always type fast.  I can still type pretty quickly, but I seem to be slipping up a lot with spelling, as my fingers type the wrong letter, or even hit the center of two different buttons at once.  Occasionally, I'll forget how to spell simple words.  (Thank God for spell check, eh?)

Recently, I downloaded the mPower app on my iPhone and have been using that to help out the research, even if I don't have PD, I'm a control.  (It's permitted to be a control.)  Is there a way to make sense of what I see in the dashboard to help me lead to anything?

All of these symptoms as, excluding the pinky tremors 11 years ago have come on pretty quickly.  Also, I haven't had a good night's sleep in over a year, when I stopped taking medications for help with sleeping, anti-depressants, and anti-anxiety.  (A lot of meds!)

I would be appreciative to anyone and everyone that would help me with any information provided.  I'll accept links, opinions, facts, anything.  I'm trying to research before I spend money to see doctors, and possibly have tests run. 

It should be noted that I take no medications.  If there are any questions I can answer, please let me know!

Thank you for making it this far,

Title says it all really - neither of us know anything about it and I'd like to look into some bumf for him to read up on.

We don't know the extent of it as he needs a few more tests - I don't even know if there are ""types"", or is it just one thing that just gets worse as time goes on?

Anesthesia refers to the suppression of activity in the central nervous system and i think the tremors caused by PD clearly shows the nerves are misfiring.

My mother sent him there because she didn’t want to take care of him anymore and has always been abusive to him, as well as the whole family. My sister and I have previously suggested divorce several times as the mother has always complained about how much he hates my dad, but has to stay with him because “she has no money.” So, if that wasn’t made clear, she has used him their whole married lives for his income, all the while treating him miserably.


I was finally able to get in touch with dad today, again urging him to get a divorce. I have reason to believe that she is stealing some of his disability check. However, he is a afraid that the courts would then give her half of all of his savings/pension/gov checks. I am not at all familiar with divorce laws. Would this happen? The kids are all grown now so she can’t use us as an excuse to say she needs the money for us. I also don’t think it would be fair for her to get any of the money from the way she’s treated him AND additionally because she is not even caring for him at this time. But again, the laws are weird so I don’t know.


I want to move him back to the US to live with me because obviously he does not like the nursing home. Financials wouldn’t be an issue because I will be starting my job as an anesthetist. I just want the divorce to happen so that I will never have to deal with the mother again. She’s poison has wasted his life (and given both my sister and I our own psych issues to struggle with). My father is forgiving and recognizes that she has mental illness, but I do not ever want to interact with her again, and I feel that will be impossible until they get the divorce. As an add on, mother is likely (ok, has to be) clinically insane, but would never admit it and go see a doctor, therefore is untreated.


TLDR: Can somebody PLEASE give me insight to what I can expect legally from a divorce between my PD father and insane mother? He’s suffered enough and I want his last years to be… as well as it can be with PD.

Was no longer feeling like I was going to be okay.

I moped around and got depressed until I made a decision that I believe will help me deal with this. Travel. I'm going to work for another two years or so and then hopefully I'll have enough saved that I can put aside a comfortable amount and take at least a year off and just go,  But not just to sight see, I'm going to take part in clinical trials and visit clinics and specialists around the world that deal with PD.

Which is why I've come here. If anyone knows any places that I should add to my trip please let me know. I'm not looking for a cure, I just want to deal with this as best I can. Plus travel was very beneficial for me in the past and I'm hoping it will be again.

I was actually searching for them so I could do a bit more research and understand everything a bit better. I've been blocking out those two/three years of my life. I haven't noticed any changes since those years ago, sometime my hands are really bad, sometimes my hands don't shake at all.

I'm just starting to think that maybe I should be a bit more concerned than I was before, and maybe I should let my doctor know that I never took any of the pills... It's just a little bit nerve-wracking (I'm only 23, turning 24 soon) and I don't really know what to expect in my coming years.

I am 26 year old male with a history of anxiety and depression. I had hand tremors when I was under stress. I had googled it and had concluded it was ET because it was not a resting tremor. I work as a software developer and have really bad management, Sometimes my stress level gets out of control. One of those times, I was under immense(unfair) pressure to deliver on some deadline, As usual the tremors showed up. After the deadline, I took the next day off. I woke up at my usual hour, realized I could sleep a bit more, I did just that, then when I woke, I felt different...... That was 3 months ago. During the first weeks, I was tired a lot, the tremors got so much worse, my hands felt slow and had an aching in my shoulders and my back. I had assumed all these symptoms were because I wasn't able to control my stress level so I joined a gym and started working out, tried not to give too much fuck about work... Symptoms did not go away but they were not getting worse either. I went to the doctor who treated my depression and got prescribed with sertraline, I felt better but the tremors got much worse, I switched to Imipramine, It was good for a week, but then the tremors... well my fingers twitch. Usually thumb and Index finger, More on the left but also on the right. This is in addition to the aching in my shoulders and back. Sometimes my voice gets really weak... When researching ET Parkinson's came up a lot on the searches so I knew of the symptoms. And to be honest, I am really terrified. Every time a finger twitches, My stress level goes through the roof. I live with my parents, but I can't talk to them or anyone about this thing - not yet anyways. I am driving myself mad with worry. I sometimes wonder if my mind is playing tricks on me. Years of depression and anxiety have not prepared me to deal with this in a better way. I'm just holding my fears in, trying not to get stressed out at work and worsening the symptoms, trying to relax. I have no friends I can talk this over with. One minute I feel it's going be okay, next minute I am preparing for worst case scenario, I find myself thinking of the only thing I know of Buddhism--""life is suffering""-- and getting short but peaceful respite from my fears.

My mother is 52 and has PD.  She was diagnosed maybe 6 years ago and is beginning to show symptoms of stage two.  She's been taking Mirapex, Amantadine, and Artane to quell her symptoms, which also have awful side effects.  She's become very anxious, very negative/depressed, and she's been shopping (for groceries, household goods, etc.) pretty excessively, which is unlike her.  She's also started experiencing hallucinations - she's home alone for the majority of the day and will hear sounds from different levels of the house as if someone is home, and I can't even imagine how that feels.

What can we do to offset the hallucinations and feelings of paranoia?  I'm currently 24, what can I do to prepare for her later stages of PD, financially or otherwise?  What are the biggest costs down the road?  And what can I do, besides spending time with her, to make her feel better about her future than she currently does?

I'm so confused, and so often saddened by this.  We haven't had much money our entire lives, so I haven't been able to afford her any traveling or anything else, and I feel really guilty about this, among other things.

I'm looking for a little insight from those who have experience acting as a primary caretaker to someone with Parkinson's, particularly spouses.  I have a boyfriend whom I love.  He is a wonderful, caring and patient person, who was diagnosed with Early Onset Parkison's last November at the age of 29, about half a year after we started dating.  This was heartbreaking news to both of us, but I am happy to report that his symptoms, while progressing, appear to be doing so quite slowly.  He's exercising and eating well and doing his best to take care of himself.

Just recently, we finally decided to go on a break.  There is no change in the way we feel about each other, but frankly, I'm afraid of the future.  I have already cared for my mother and watched her degenerate and die under the influence of a brain tumor, and whenever people tell me how strong I am or how good a daughter I was, all I can think of are the times when I lost my temper, wasn't patient enough, blamed her for things she couldn't control, or didn't give her the best care possible due to ignorance.  Being a caretaker is tough for so many reasons--I gave up my job and my life in California for two years to see Mom through the cancer, and it left me with memories that make me cry even now, four years later--in fact, I'm actually crying right now recalling it, because nothing hurts like watching someone you love suffer.
 
Now, I'm faced with a really shitty decision: Am I going to commit to my boyfriend, who needs love and support more than ever in order to deal with this incredibly annoying and ultimately incapacitating illness (I've been researching, and so I know about the medical cocktail, the side effects, and the non-motor symptoms of the disease), or am I going to reject him and save myself the years of frustration and heartache and financial and physical struggle?  

This isn't meant to be a melodramatic rhetorical question; I actually want to know both the good and the bad of being the spouse of someone with Parkinson's.  That means nuts and bolts stuff--how did you deal with finances, did it impact your ability or decision to raise a family, do you (please be honest) regret your decision, how much has your loved one changed physically and mentally, and do you have any tips?  

I hope you guys aren't going to knee-jerk tell me I'm a cold-hearted bitch for being afraid to face a future with a wonderful, loving guy who needs me.  If I do stay with him, I'll always want to do my best to help him, and that includes never ever reproaching him or pitying myself.  But when I look at my peers and see how exhausting it can be to raise a family with two healthy parents (and two incomes), I'm honestly just terrified that being with him will mean making sacrifices I'm not prepared to make.  I'm not a saint, and I'm not even very patient by nature--but I do care about him, and when I think about him going through this on his own--tough as he is--I can't bring myself to walk away, either.

I've been wrangling with this dilemma for a year, now, so any insights or experiences you might have to share with me would be deeply, deeply appreciated.

Sorry for the long post.

It was not a surprise, since he has been having balance issues, volume challenges with his voice and weakened muscles. I would say that he is Stage 2, moving into 3.

But now I feel I have to make a major life decision. 

He lives in England, and I moved to the US over 25 years ago. His only caregiver is my step-mother who has never been to a doctor's appointment with him, denies that he has any problems (last time I visited he fell over five times in one week), and likes to talk about how hard this will make her life and what she will do with his money when he is gone. Superbitch and has been for ever. 

I plan to go to England for a few weeks to advocate for him with his doctors and to ask him to consider coming to me when she wants to put him in a home. I might even take paperwork for Oregon's legal euthanasia in which he has expressed interest. 

If he won't come to me then I could rent my house and re-establish residency in the UK. 

So many thoughts and I am trying not to rush to decisions. What advise can you give me?",2014-09-01 10:42:16

She's had tremors, dementia, depression, low blood pressure, pain, bladder problems, sleeping problems, slurred speech, and cramped writing.
    
I thought the sudden onset of recent symptoms and the persistence of minor sympoms (like slurred speech and tremors) was due to her medication.  She's been on heavy medication for multiple diagnoses of mental illness for most of her life.  Things just kept getting worse this time, though, and she didn't seem to really recover with the psychotropic medication adjustments.  It doesn't help that she's got virtually no income, resources, or friends.  I've tried to get her to move to where I am, but she refuses.
    
At this point, although Parkinson's has no cure, I'm relieved to know the cause.  I've been quite worried about her, and live thousands of miles away.

I've had issues with my lower back and my left hip for years thanks to an injury in the Army.  The pain was intense, but the painkillers I had were enough to calm things down.  I went to bed and made an appointment with the VA the next day.

Little did I know that I would not be able to return to work.  For two months the VA bounced me around clinics as more symptoms began to develop.  My right hand started to tremor, my joints became stiff and hurt, and it became difficult to walk.  

Soon I was in a wheelchair, having to rely on my wife and our partner for my daily care.  I could no longer dress myself, drive, cook, or even use the bathroom without help.  The stiffness and joint pain began to ignore every painkiller I threw at it.  

One night, after talking to a VA crisis counselor in a fit of suicidal depression, I went to WebMD.  I know, self-diagnosing yourself is obnoxious and yada yada yada.  What I noticed is that a number of the symptoms for early-onset Parkinson were present, but masked as a development of my pre-existing disability.  The VA was looking in the wrong place.

A neurological consult came next, followed by a three hour MRI and what felt like a gallon of blood drawn for tests.  We began to isolate issues, tease apart what was the Army injury, and what wasn't.

Last week, the hammer came down.  Early-onset Parkinson's with aggravation in the hips, pelvis, and lower back.  I started Levodopa for confirmation and within a day, I was able to walk and go to the bathroom on my own.  It hasn't helped the tremors, and I know I have to go off the drug and switch to another, but for now I feel human again.  

If I skip a pill, it's right back into the wheelchair.  Always take your pills kids!

I still can't work and I know I have years of therapy and medical treatments ahead of me.  I'm doing what I can to provide financially for my family, hoping to offset the 40% loss of income from going on long-term disability.  I'm excited about going back to school (hooray online courses) and hopefully I'll find a treatment that gets me back to work.

In the meantime, as difficult as this has been, I know I have what's necessary to carry on with life.  I guess that's why I typed it. ",2014-08-15 09:22:47

My father has the disease and I have begun to notice very subtle signs that I may have it as well. 

I notice an uncontrollable tremor in my fingers when making precise movements... particularly if I try to do them slowly. I can feel the distant pulsing clench in my toes when I go to sleep. 

I know this does not equate to a medical diagnosis, and I definitely intend to consult with a professional in the future. Right now however I am just trying to think about what this means for my future, and how I might adjust my lifestyle to potentially manage the disease in the long term. 

I was wondering if there were any others in this forum who were diagnosed with Parkinsons at a relatively young age, and what the progression of symptoms was like for them. 

My father has been diagnosed with the disease for 20 years, and although his current condition is not great (he is 72), it has not be a tragically life-altering experience. So I am not terrified, I just want to come up with a plan for myself. 

The other thing I am thinking about is how to discuss the issue with those around me. So far I have not mentioned my suspicions to my friends, my parents, or my wife... and no one has taken notice of my tremor. I feel particularly anxious about discussing the issue with my parents, who would be crestfallen to learn that I have Parkinsons, if that is the case. 

If you are a younger person with Parkinsons, (or someone who got Parkinsons at a young age) I would like to ask, at what point did you begin to notice the symptoms? At what point were you formally diagnosed? What has been the rate of progression of symptoms? And what medical treatment (if any) did you receive in the early years of your diagnosis?

Parkure (http://parkure.co.uk) in a new UK based company with the sole mission to find a cure for Parkinson's disease. We have developed a living system assay for testing drugs against Parkinson's. The assay's throughput makes it ideal for repurposing already safety tested or even marketed drugs in order to see if they have an effect on the disease. This has been an approach adopted by the likes of the Michael J. Fox Foundation, Parkinson's UK and the Cure Parkinson's Trust (e.g. http://goo.gl/Mqi0wd).

We have established a good relationship with all the main non-profits and we are about to start raising funding via crowdfunding (equity return) this September. In order to achieve this we need the community's help. 

You can support us either financially or you can just help to spread the word. For more info please have a look here http://parkure.co.uk/support-us/

Please feel free to contact us on twitter @ParkureUK or via email at info@parkure.co.uk

Best regards,
The Parkure team...

But the final diagnosis was given today and I'm surprisingly in shock. 

I have done the whole google thing, which I know is the worst but I couldn't help it. The fact that it is a progressive and degenerative disease is the part I am struggling with. I am 22 and I'm now starting to think about the future and all the 'what ifs'. 

I tried to stay open minded at first when the doctors said it could be PD, but the stereotype of this disease relating to an older age (my mother is only 53) has stuck with me - she is too young to have problems with movement and memory and so on!

On the positive side, I have heard good things about the medical advances for PD and how the right medication really does work.

He's definitely been slowing down recently (sort of shuffling), shaking when doing small things like pulling out his wallet or writing, his memory has become worse, gets a weird blank look on his face, and goes to bed hours earlier than he used to. I've been at college the last few years and thought maybe he was depressed or something, but my mom who sees him daily got so upset (not at him personally, she just knew something was going on) she set up a few doctor's appointments, who sent him to the neurologist, who says he has PD due to some brain diminishing and shaking... He's also anxious ALL the time and doesn't like talking to people anymore.

Anyways,

I'm a little freaked out. Not terrified, I've just always correlated PD with being like 80 years old and on the verge of dying (I know that sucks, but I never grew up with grandparents or had to deal with elderly people and don't really have knowledge about brain diseases more common as you get older). I've read that this isn't really life threatening, but it sucks to see him devolve into this half old man half toddler state of being. He used to do things he loves (great guitarist and song writer, very social) but know he sits around all day. He can only do one thing per day really, like if he goes to the grocery store that's it, he will not go out again.

Thanks for reading. If you have had this experience, maybe you can let me know what to expect from here. They doc's putting him on some meds in two weeks or so.

Edit: Actually he was diagnosed Tuesday and I just learned about it today....",2014-06-20 10:33:27

I left the neurologist’s office in a daze of disbelief. The sensation I felt upon leaving the doctor's office was as though the weight of the world had just been placed upon my shoulders. I felt profound sadness and also bitterness for this added lot that had just been handed to me. My mind began spinning to the past in search of answers, and into the future imagining what my life would be like. Loneliness, fear and doubt began to creep into my thoughts. This was without exception the greatest blow to my peace of mind and sense of self-worth I had ever experienced.

I remember praying with all my heart that God would remove this trial. How could this happen to me? I’d lived a healthy life free of cigarettes, alcohol, and drugs. I’d been physically active and considered myself an accomplished athlete. Since my late teens, 

I had devoted my life to serving others. How could this bad thing happen to this good person? Perhaps it was a misdiagnosis, I thought.

No matter what you can afford, every dollar counts! So please make a donation on my behalf. Alternatively, if you would prefer, you can join my team or register as an individual.

In addition to participating in ""Moving Day"", I am donating a portion of my book proceeds to The National Parkinson's Foundation. If you have not yet had a chance to read the book, I hope you will order a copy soon. The book is entitled, ""Peace With Parkinson's""... ""It's Called a Resting Tremor, Not an Earthquake"".

Dear Friends and Fellow Parkinsonian's,
Today is a big day. Those of you that know me are aware of my passion toward finding a cure for Parkinson's and other chronic illnesses. Well, today is the day my book ""Peace With Parkinson's"" is being launched into the world and I need your help.
Peace With Parkinson's was written as a guidebook and comfort for mind, body and spirit for the chronically ill and those loved ones that bear the responsibility of care giving. The book is written as a brief memoir of the authors life, the adversity he faced and the coping lessons he learned following his Parkinson's diagnosis seven years ago.  
The first step is to visit:  http://www.amazon.com/Peace-Parkinsons-Called-Resting-Earthquake/dp/1495264319/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1402873904&sr=1-1&keywords=mark+colo
By ordering the book today, you can generate additional funding for the Foundation Institute for Neurological Diseases, FINDCURE.NET, a startup foundation committed to finding a cure for Neurological disease. The editor of the book is world renown Barbara McNichol, based in Tucson, and when you take a look, you will realize that she’s done a stellar job in making the concepts clear and understandable
What I really need from you, however, is this - Tell your friends, tell your colleagues, tell everyone! Even if you might not need the gift of ""Peace With Parkinson's"", I bet you know plenty of people who do!
We are launching our extensive media campaign both online and off, and you are part of it! Use your Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram or Google+ presence to let people know, even a good old email would do.
Thank you for your continued interest and support. It has been a long yet exciting journey to get these concepts to market, and you have been a key part of it. Our discussions have been very useful as we talked through these ideas and made sure that they would reach out to and inspire both you and everyone else who would like to reduce Life Turbulence in their life.
Let the revolution begin!
All the best,
Mark Colo

He said he has known for the past couple weeks but it is hard for him to talk about. He says he has been to three specialists. 

My sisters get very upset as if he is dying. They don't understand why I'm not upset and are offended. I told them that it isn't a death sentence. They think dad has had it for a few years now and his hands shake. That as it gets worse I will address it. 

So I looked up information about parkinson's because I knew some stuff but not a lot. In my home town, the nursery home I worked for, has a monthly meeting for people and their families with parkinson's. I talked to my dad about eating right and excercise (he is overweight) and all the things he could do that won't stop it but will help. 

He will not even talk about it. Neither will his wife or my sisters. 

So my dad is getting a forth opinion on the 19th. I wanted to go with because I will be in town but he won't let me. 

If they tell him again that it is Parkinson's I do not know if he will continue to not discuss it, continue to deny it, or break down. If he will want information about the group, if he will try to take care of his body, if he will give up, etc. 

He says he isn't depressed and that I shouldn't worry about him. That it is just a pinched nerve (even though three specialists say otherwise). 

I have no one to talk to about it. The only event in my area was for a long bike ride I couldn't attend and one for 11am on a Friday (I work), is it okay for me to go to a group without my parent. Obviously I cannot help if he doesn't want it but I'm also here if he needs it. Though I want to be prepared. I already have a hard enough time only seeing him maybe once a year. He looks more gray every year... 

I just don't know... I'm alone in this.

Below are a few snippets of his hallucinations from this week as emailed to me by his wife.

------

Sunday, February 2nd, 2014

Your dad was very agitated with hallucinations this am.  
He thought there was a guy with a gas mask in our bedroom ….he said for 3 hours from before I woke him up this morning. He ask for his “bang-bang” again last night and this morning. [Note: all guns have been removed from his access - there were previous incidents with the guns] He was so convinced there was someone in the house that he wanted to call the cops or TSA and ask them about it.

I had to get [son] out of bed to sit with him until [caregiver] got there.
We couldn't find his insulin kit this am and I had to piece one together from spare stuff.
He didn't want to take his insulin and seemed to be very suspicious of the insulin doses.  So I think he might have hidden his insulin meter somewhere, but said he didn't when I asked him about it.  I have been having to name each of his pills when I give them to him too….instead of him just taking them like he used to.  So I think he is getting paranoid about more stuff than he was.  

------

Wednesday, February 5th, 2014

Last night he said the people in the attic had left and moved out.  He couldn’t elaborate on why or where they went. However he got real agitated as he thought they took all the keys and checkbooks with them and said we needed to take all the money out of the bank and close the accounts and have new keys made.  He got mad and yelled at me when I was trying to get him to explain better about something else.

He still insists that someone is there (a guy) shooting him with a blow gun and little tiny dart like things.
I also caught him inspecting his hand like the little glass flying insects were on it….but he wouldn't admit to it when I ask what he was doing and if there was something wrong with his hand.

I asked him if he was sleeping so much to avoid having hallucinations, or if they got to him and he felt safer in bed and that is why I find him in bed a lot of times when I get home, but he said he was just really tired a lot.

I couldn’t help busting out laughing (didn’t mean to) and I said Se Habla Espanol ?? to [dog] and of course he perked up and started walking in my directions…which poppa noticed we will see if he thinks the dog still “speaks Spanish” this weekend.

He didn't tell us really until the following year, which is also the year that I graduated High School. I didn't really know how to handle it then . . . and the advanced symptoms seemed so far away that I didn't really consider the impact. 

I love my dad. I don't really have the words to describe how I think of him other than: ""He is a kind badass"". That's not a typo. He is extremely kind and patient with everyone, even people he doesn't like very much. He is also smart as hell, used to drag race in the streets of San Francisco as a kid, lied about his age to join the Coast Guard, became a pilot, then an engineer, and went on to get his MBA and became a pretty amazing businessman. 

Anyway, when I was little, sometimes he would talk about the things he and I would do together when I got older, like I would drive him to the bars and finish fights for him. Just his sense of humor I guess.

I went away to school soon after high school ended, and every time I'd come home to visit, I could see how much of my Dad was being taken away from us. Sometimes the side effects of the drugs were worse than the disease. I almost died inside thinking that he might not be able to dance with my sister at her wedding. I still do when I think of so many things.

Since then he's had the deep brain stimulation surgery, and that was working really well for a long time, but it seems like the degeneration is happening more quickly with time. I'm crying a little bit while typing this, but I just don't know how to handle it, and I'm hoping that some anonymous voice from the internet can help me make a little sense of it. I love my father. He's always been the yardstick I measured myself against, even though I feel like I've never quite made it. 

I guess what it comes down to is not just that I don't want him to die, obviously, but even more than that I don't want him to die any less of a human being because of what is happening to him. Its not fair, and its not right. 

My problem is that, like I mentioned before, I didn't know how to handle it initially, so I did what we all seemed to be doing at the time, which was just to ignore the problem, and by doing that, I somehow convinced myself that I had more time to do with him the things I'd always assumed that we would. And now? Now I can see that I'll never be able to drive him to the bar and finish a fight for him. I wasted that time we could have had together, and I regret ever second gone.
