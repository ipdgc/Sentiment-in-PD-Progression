# Sentiment Analysis in Parkinson's Disease

## Motivation
Blogs, social media, news outlets, online patient forums, and other sources of online media have rapidly increased the sharing of disease experience. Parkinson's disease is no different; large communities of both patients and caregivers have found homes on the internet, sharing symptoms, drug responses, and general day to day life. Obtaining and processing this large amount of textual data can provide unique insights into the patient experience.
